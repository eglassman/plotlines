<br />
A young man stands in his bedroom. It just so happens that today, the 13th of April, is this young man's birthday. Though it was thirteen years ago he was given life, it is only today he will be given a name!
<br />

<br />
What will the name of this young man be?<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/13/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001902">"Enter name."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/13/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001903">"Try again."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/13/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001904">"Examine room."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your name is JOHN. As was previously mentioned it is your BIRTHDAY. A number of CAKES are scattered about your room. You have a variety of INTERESTS. You have a passion for REALLY TERRIBLE MOVIES. You like to program computers but you are NOT VERY GOOD AT IT. You have a fondness for PARANORMAL LORE, and are an aspiring AMATEUR MAGICIAN. You also like to play GAMES sometimes.
<br />

<br />
What will you do?<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/13/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001905">"John: Quickly retrieve arms from drawer."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your ARMS are in your MAGIC CHEST, pooplord!<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/13/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001906">"Remove CAKE from MAGIC CHEST."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Out of sympathy for John's perceived lack of arms, you pick up the CAKE for him and put it on his BED.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/13/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001907">"John: Quickly retrieve arms from MAGIC CHEST."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You retrieve your FAKE ARMS from the chest. You use these for HILARIOUS ANTICS. 
<br />

<br />
You CAPTCHALOGUE them in your SYLLADEX. You have no idea what that actually means though.
<br />

<br />
There are other items in the chest.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/13/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001908">"John: Examine contents of chest."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
In here you keep an array of humorous and mystical ARTIFACTS, each one a devastating weapon in the hands of a SKILLED MAGICIAN or a CUNNING PRANKSTER.
<br />

<br />
You are neither of these things.
<br />

<br />
Among the ARTIFACTS are: TWO (2) FAKE ARMS [CURRENTLY CAPTCHALOGUED IN YOUR SYLLADEX], ONE (1) PAIR OF TRICK HANDCUFFS, ONE (1) STUNT SWORD, ONE (1) MAGICIAN'S HAT, ONE (1) PAIR OF BEAGLE PUSS GLASSES, SEVERAL (~) SMOKE PELLETS, SEVERAL (~) BLOOD CAPSULES, and ONE (1) COPY OF COLONEL SASSACRE'S DAUNTING TEXT OF MAGICAL FRIVOLITY AND PRACTICAL JAPERY, and ONE (1) COPY OF HARRY ANDERSON'S &quot;WISE GUY&quot;, BY MIKE CAVENEY.
<br />

<br />
Some of this stuff may come in handy at some point. For now, you decide to just take the SMOKE PELLETS.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/13/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001909">"John: Captchalogue smoke pellets."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You stow the SMOKE PELLETS on one of your CAPTCHALOGUE CARDS in your SYLLADEX.
<br />

<br />
You still aren't totally sure what that means, but you are starting to get the hang of the vernacular at least.
<br />

<br />
You have two empty CAPTCHALOGUE CARDS remaining.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/13/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001910">"John: Equip fake arms."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You aren't totally sure if &quot;EQUIP&quot; is a verb copasetic with the abstract behavioral medium in which you dwell, but you give it a try anyway.
<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, you cannot access the FAKE ARMS! Their card is underneath the one you just used to captchalogue the SMOKE PELLETS. You will have to use the pellets first in order to access the arms. But this is probably unadvisable, since you'd just make your room lousy with smoke!
<br />

<br />
Your SYLLADEX'S FETCH MODUS is currently dictated by the logic of a STACK DATA STRUCTURE. You were never all that great with data structures and you find the concept puzzling and mildly irritating.
<br />

<br />
But with any hope, perhaps you will advance new, more practical FETCH MODI for your SYLLADEX with a little more experience.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/13/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001911">"John: Examine Problem Sleuth Poster."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Is it even possible to get any more hard boiled than that? You really doubt it. <a href="http://www.topatoco.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&amp;Store_Code=TO&amp;Category_Code=MSPA-ART" target="_blank" class="postlink">This poster was one of your wisest purchases.</a>
<br />

<br />
There is a nice spot on the wall next to it. You've been meaning to hang another poster there soon.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/13/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001912">"John: Read note on drawer."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This note is rich with the aromas of FATHERLY AFTERSHAVES AND COLOGNES.
<br />

<br />
Beside the note is a ROLLED UP POSTER.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/13/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001913">"John: Take poster."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Another BIRTHDAY ARTIFACT. You wonder what is printed on the poster.
<br />

<br />
You'll need some way to hang it on your wall.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/13/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001914">"John: Acquire hammer and nails. They will come in handy."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You first place the HAMMER into your SYLLADEX.
<br />

<br />
But now all of your CAPTCHALOGUE CARDS are full. You wonder what will happen if you try to take the NAILS? 
<br />

<br />
You guess it doesn't hurt to try.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/13/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001915">"John: Take nails."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You captchalogue FOUR (4) NAILS into the top card, and push all the ARTIFACTS down a card.
<br />

<br />
The FAKE ARMS are pushed entirely out of the deck!!!
<br />

<br />
Oh well. They're probably completely useless anyway. But you probably don't want to do that again, unless you want to drop the SMOKE PELLETS and suffer the consequences.
<br />

<br />
In any case, you now feel like you have gathered enough things to get down to business and do some really important stuff. The next thing you do will probably be exceptionally meaningful.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/13/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001916">"John: Squawk like an imbecile and shit on your desk."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This is the dumbest idea you've had in weeks!!!
<br />

<br />
STUPID STUPID STUPID.
<br />

<br />
And yet the polished surface of your desk...
<br />

<br />
It beckons.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/14/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001917">"John: Combine the nails and hammer."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You MERGE the top two cards. 
<br />

<br />
The HAMMER and NAILS are now captchalogued on the same card and can be used together.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/14/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001918">"John: Use hammer/nails on poster."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You use the HAMMER and NAILS card IN CONJUNCTION with the card beneath it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/14/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001919">"John: Nail poster to wall."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You use the HAMMER, NAILS, and POSTER on the blank space on the wall. 
<br />

<br />
It's glorious. Exactly what you wanted. The old man really came through this time.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/14/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001920">"John: Examine Con Air poster."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
PUT THE BUNNY BACK IN THE BOX.
<br />

<br />
I SAID, PUT THE BUNNY BACK IN THE BOX.
<br />

<br />
WHY COULDN'T YOU PUT THE BUNNY BACK IN THE BOX?<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/14/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001921">"John: Examine Deep Impact poster."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Morgan Freeman's genteel, homespun mannerisms were perfect qualities for a president residing over a crisis. 
<br />

<br />
OCEANS RISE. CITIES FALL. HOPE SURVIVES.
<br />

<br />
WOW.
<br />

<br />
Films about impending apocalypse fascinate you. Plus, a black president??? Now you've seen everything!<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/14/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001922">"John: Examine calendar."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You've marked your birthday, the 13th of April. Another day you marked was supposed to be the arrival date for the highly touted SBURB <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=5" target="_blank" class="postlink">BETA LAUNCH</a>. 
<br />

<br />
It's been three days already. It's starting to become a sore subject with you.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/14/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001923">"John: Eat cake."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are sick to death of cake!!! You've been eating it all day. And you have no intention of clogging your SYLLADEX with it either. The CAKE stays put for now.
<br />

<br />
You hear a notice from your COMPUTER. Someone is messaging you.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/15/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001924">"John: Examine incoming message."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You pull up to your COMPUTER. This is where you spend most of your time. You decorated your desktop with some rather handsome WALLPAPER which you made yourself. You are really proud of it.
<br />

<br />
Your desktop is also littered with various PROGRAMMING PROJECT FILES. You are so bad at programming sometimes you wonder why you even bother with it.
<br />

<br />
Your PESTERCHUM application is flashing. Someone is trying to get in touch with you.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/15/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001925">"John: Open Pesterchum."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Only one of your CHUMS is logged in. He's sent you a message.<br><br><br>

<span style="color: #e00707">TG: hey so what sort of insane loot did you rake in today</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i got a little monsters poster, it's so awesome. i'm going to watch it again today, the applejuice scene was so funny.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: oh hell that is such a coincidence i just found an unopened container of apple juice in my closet it is like fucking christmas up in here</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok thats fine, but i just have one question and then a word of caution. have you ever seen a movie called little monsters starring howie mandel and fred savage?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: but </span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: the seal on the bottle is unbroken</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: are you suggesting someone put piss in my apple juice at the factory</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: all im saying is don't you think monster howie mandel has the power to do something as simple as reseal a bottle?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: try using your brain numbnuts.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: why did the fat kid or whoever drank it know what piss tasted like</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i mean his reaction was nigh instantaneous</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: it was the 15th day in a row howie mandel peed in his juice.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: ok i can accept that </span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: monster B-list celebrity douchebags are cunning and persistent pranksters</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: also fred savage has a really punchable face</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: but who cares about this lets stop talking about it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: did you get the beta yet</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: no.</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: did you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: man i got two copies already</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: but i dont care im not going to play it or anything the game sounds boring</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: did you see how it got slammed in game bro????</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: game bro is a joke and we both know it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: yeah</span>

 <b> 04/15/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001927">"John: Look out window."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You see the view of your yard from your window.
<br />

<br />
Hanging from the tree is your TIRE SWING. In a kid's yard, a tree without a tire swing is like a proper gentleman without a monocle. That is to say, HE CAN HARDLY BE CONSIDERED A TERRIBLY PROPER GENTLEMAN AT ALL. 
<br />

<br />
And there beside your driveway is the mailbox.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/15/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001928">"John: Examine mailbox."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The little red arm-swingy-dealy thing or whatever it is called is flipped up!
<br />

<br />
What the hell is that thing called anyway. You do not have time for these semantics. The red flippy-lever thing means you have new mail. And that means the beta might be here!<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/15/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001929">"John: Go outside and check mailbox."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are about to hurry down stairs when you hear a car pull into the driveway. It looks like your DAD has returned from the grocery store.
<br />

<br />
Oh great. He is beating you to the mail.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/15/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001930">"John: Forget it. Check mail later."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
If you go down stairs to get it, he will likely monopolize hours of your time. You decide to chill out up here for a while until the dust settles.
<br />

<br />
Sometimes you feel like you are trapped in this room. Stuck, if you will, in a sense which possibly borders on the titular.
<br />

<br />
And now your chum is pestering you again. The clockwork of friendship turns ceaselessly, operating the swing-lever dealies of harassment in perpetuity!
<br />

<br />
Whatever. The dude can just hold his damn horses.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/16/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001931">"John: Examine games on CD rack."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You've put countless manhours into this assortment of quality titles.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/16/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001932">"John: Read COLONEL SASSACRE'S DAUNTING TEXT."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You decide to consult with the Colonel's bottomless wisdom. Good grief this thing is huge. It could kill a cat if you dropped it.
<br />

<br />
But to really dig into this hefty book, you will have to captchalogue it. You are not sure you are ready to logjam your other ARTIFACTS beneath it just yet.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/16/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001933">"John: Captchalogue fake arms again."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
What did you just say?? You don't want to clog up your...
<br />

<br />
Oh, Jesus. In a momentary lapse of concentration, you accidentally captchalogue the arms again.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/16/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001934">"John: Set Pesterchum status to &quot;bully&quot;."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You don't think the situation is quite dire enough to go all the way to &quot;RANCOROUS&quot;, but you still feel the PESTERCHUM client should reflect your mood change in some way.
<br />

<br />
&quot;BULLY&quot; will have to do. You guess.
<br />

<br />
This unsurprisingly does nothing whatsoever.
<br />

<br />
Oh, right, you forgot your chum is still pestering you.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/16/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001935">"John: Answer chum."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: you should probably brush up on your data structures</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i guess.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: did you at least allocate your strife specibus</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: no.</span>

<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: just get rid of the arms and then allocate the hammer to the specibus</span>

 <b> 04/16/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001936">"John: Combine fake arms with cake."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You stick the FAKE ARMS in the CAKE on your bed.
<br />

<br />
This definitely makes the CAKE at least 300% more hilarious. You're sure COLONEL SASSACRE would know the precise index of elevated hilarity.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/16/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001937">"John: Allocate hammer to strife specibus."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 04/17/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001940">"John: Captchalogue Colonel's big book."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Now that you've got some space in your SYLLADEX to work with, you figure you might as well start squandering it immediately.
<br />

<br />
Ordinarily this ridiculous book would be way too heavy to carry around in any practical way. You guess maybe this is one respect in which the cards present some convenience.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/17/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001941">"John: Examine GameBro Magazine."</a></b><br><br>

It might come in handy if you ever need something that burns easily.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/18/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001944">"John: Captchalogue magician's hat."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You expend your final card on the MAGICIAN'S HAT.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/18/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001945">"John: Get funny glasses too."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You don't have a free card in your SYLLADEX!
<br />

<br />
However, you are able to MERGE the BEAGLE PUSS with the MAGICIAN'S HAT to create a <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;q=beagle+puss&amp;btnG=Search+Images&amp;gbv=2&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=" target="_blank" class="postlink">CLEVER DISGUISE</a>.<br><br><br>

<br />
John? Who is this &quot;John&quot; you speak of? You are quite certain there has never been, nor ever will be...
<br />

<br />
Yeah, this is a really shitty disguise.
<br />

<br />
While you are wearing the items, they remain on the card, but it is temporarily removed from the deck, thus freeing up the cards beneath it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/18/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001947">"John: Leave room."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You exit into the HALLWAY.
<br />

<br />
On one wall hangs a picture of a fella who sure knows how to have a laugh, a man after your own heart. You always thought he looked a lot like Michael Cera. But your DAD swears on the many HALLOWED TOMBS of Egypt that it is not. You're not sure about that though.
<br />

<br />
On the other wall is one of your DAD'S stupid clowns. Or HARLEQUINS, as he is quick to correct anyone who would venture such brazen assumption.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/18/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001948">"John: Go downstairs."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The accursed odor of fresh baking wafts into your newfound nostrils. Something is brewing in the KITCHEN. It must be the connivings of your arch nemesis, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Crocker" target="_blank" class="postlink">BETTY CROCKER</a>, and the rich, buttery aroma of her plot stinks to high heaven.
<br />

<br />
This mission is going to be more difficult than you imagined.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/18/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001949">"John: Admire harlequins."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You check out the shelves of FANCIFUL HARLEQUINS.
<br />

<br />
Look at this fucking garbage. You hate this stuff. Funny is funny, but your DAD sure can be a real cornball.
<br />

<br />
Sometimes at night you pray for burglars.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/18/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001950">"John: Examine fireplace."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
A bright orange flame flickers in the FIREPLACE. It doesn't matter that it's April and not terribly chilly outside. In a home, a FIREPLACE needs a fire, because that's what FIREPLACE is for. A fire BELONGS in a FIREPLACE, dammit, cata(ptcha)gorically, at all times, without exception.
<br />

<br />
As domestic myth of unaccountable origin holds, a home borrows the spirit of the flame for as long as it makes a guest of it, much as the moon takes liberty with the sun's rays.
<br />

<br />
&quot;The moon's an arrant thief, and her pale fire she snatches from the sun.&quot;  -Mark Twain

<br />

<br />
You examine the SACRED URN containing your departed NANNA'S ASHES.
<br />

<br />
When your father gives her portrait a wistful glance now and then, you can tell it brings back painful memories. A tall bookshelf. A ladder. An unabridged COLONEL SASSACRE'S. 
<br />

<br />
He never wants to talk about it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/18/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001953">"John: Topple urn."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You clumsily mishandle the SACRED URN. Ash is everywhere.
<br />

<br />
In retrospect, upon mulling cinematic tropes regarding ash-filled urns, this outcome was a virtual certainty.
<br />

<br />
You'd probably better clean it up before DAD finds it.<br><br><br>

 <b> 04/18/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001955">"John: Examine oversized gift."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Contemplating what could be inside this package is sort of exciting, but it makes you a little nervous at the same time.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/18/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001956">"John: Open large present."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Oh hell no.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/19/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001957">"John: Captchalogue ashes."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
First you prop the HARLEQUIN DOLL up on the couch. Having it in the middle of the floor sprawled out all akimbo like that struck you as unseemly.
<br />

<br />
You captchalogue the ASHES to your available card.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/19/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001958">"John: Combine ashes with urn."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You merge the SACRED URN with the ASHES.
<br />

<br />
Most of the ASH is back in the URN, but it's a total mess. Really it probably would have been tidier if you just used a broom and dustpan.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/19/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001959">"John: Put urn back."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
No one will be the wiser. 
<br />

<br />
Except maybe for people with eyes.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/19/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001960">"John: Go get fake arms again."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You just got another BRILLIANT idea for something to do with those pointless arms. You pry them out of the CAKE and captchalogue them.
<br />

<br />
Looks like PESTERCHUM is acting up again.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/19/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001961">"John: Examine 3rd and 4th walls of room."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/19/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001962">"John: Check Pesterchum."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Another one of your chums is messaging you.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/19/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001963">"John: Check message."</a></b><br><br>

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I understand you have recently come into possession of the beta release of &quot;The Game of the Year&quot;, as featured in respectable periodicals such as GameBro Magazine.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: that's an ugly rumor.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: whoever told you that is a filthy liar.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: and you should probably stop hitting on him all the time or whatever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I can't control myself. </span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I must have a weakness for insufferable pricks. </span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: anyway i still haven't checked the mail, my dad has it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i'm trying to go get it from him, so brb</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: John.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You're wearing one of your disguises now, aren't you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You are typing to me right now while wearing something ridiculous.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: no, why would you even think that??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: that's so stupid.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Why don't you go get the game from your father?</span>
<br />

<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh, btw...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: jk I was wearing a funny disguise this whole time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: gotcha! hehehehe</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I know, John.</span><br><br><br>
 <b> 04/19/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001964">"John: Go back downstairs."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You can now execute that brilliant idea you had.
<br />

<br />
There should be just enough FROSTING on the FAKE ARMS to serve as an adequate adhesive.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/19/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001965">"John: Attach arms to doll."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Hehehehehehehehe.
<br />

<br />
You don't care what COLONEL SASSACRE says, that makes it AT LEAST a million percent funnier.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/20/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001966">"John: Inspect burnt paper on the floor."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You put this back in the fire where it belongs.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/20/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001967">"John: Throw present wrap in fire."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
As long as you're cleaning up...<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/20/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001968">"John: Captchalogue doll."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You can carry hefty items, but that thing is just way too big. Get real!
<br />

<br />
Besides, you don't even want it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/20/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001969">"John: Read Colonel Sassacre's text."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You thought about consulting the text to determine exactly how hilarious the doll is now.
<br />

<br />
But this text is way too big to navigate in a timely fashion. You decide to forget it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/20/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001970">"John: Find dad and retrieve mail."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The door on the left leads to the KITCHEN, from which the smell of baking wafts -- a powerful aroma which could lift an especially portly hobo off his feet.
<br />

<br />
The door on the right leads to the STUDY, where your DAD spends a lot of time. 
<br />

<br />
He could be in either room. Where will you go?<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/21/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001971">"John: Go in the study."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It doesn't look like he's in here right now.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/21/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001972">"John: Examine father's desk."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
On the desk is a DECK OF PLAYING CARDS, one of your DAD'S PIPES, the April issue of THE SERIOUS JESTER magazine, and a stray CAPTCHALOGUE CARD.
<br />

<br />
There is also a CAN OF PEANUTS on the desk. Ha ha, oh DAD. You won't be falling for THAT one again any time soon.
<br />

<br />
A severe peanut allergy is a terrible affliction to cope with.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/21/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001973">"John: Upgrade costume with hat from hat rack."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You swap the MAGICIAN'S HAT with the BOWLER HAT.
<br />

<br />
This disguise is somewhat less funny, but A LOT more distinguished looking.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/21/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001974">"John: Combine second pipe with clever disguise."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your DAD maintains numerous pipes around the household. A father without a pipe is like a strapping roughneck without a toothpick. That is to say, HE IS A RATHER PISS-POOR EXCUSE FOR A ROUGHNECK IF YOU ASK ME.
<br />

<br />
You'd rather not take the PIPE, though. The first one tastes bad enough as it is.
<br />

<br />
How you suffer for your comedy.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/21/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001975">"John: Examine captchalogue card."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Yes!!! This will be perfect for expanding the space in your SYLLA...<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/21/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001976">"John: Captchalogue captchalogue card."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
ARGH!!!<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/21/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001977">"[S] John: Play haunting piano refrain."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
(Pages including sound will be preceded by [S] in the command.)<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/22/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001978">"John: Play 52 Pick-Up."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You play the prankster's favorite card game, even though you are alone in the room, thus rendering it an especially foolish version of Solitaire.
<br />

<br />
SO STUPID. Look at this mess.
<br />

<br />
The peanut gallery over there sure is getting a kick out of it. You are allergic to their scorn.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/22/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001979">"John: Attempt to leave the house."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You go back into the LIVING ROOM and contemplate checking the mailbox outside. You think perhaps you should exhaust all possibilities before plunging headlong into a DAD encounter.
<br />

<br />
Your TELEVISION is currently airing a COMMERCIAL.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/23/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001980">"John: Exit."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You exit the house.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/23/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001981">"John: Check mail."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Predictably, the mailbox is empty. You have already been scooped by your father.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001982">"[S] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The streets are empty. Wind skims the voids keeping neighbors apart, as if grazing the hollow of a cut reed, or say, a plundered mailbox. A familiar note is produced. It's the one Desolation plays to keep its instrument in tune.
<br />

<br />
It is your thirteenth birthday, and as with all twelve preceding it, something feels missing from your life. The game presently eluding you is only the latest sleight of hand in the repertoire of an unseen riddler, one to engender a sense not of mirth, but of lack. His coarse schemes are those less of a prankster than a common pickpocket. His riddle is Absence itself. It is a mystery dispersing altogether, like the moon's faint reflection, with even one pebble of inquiry dropped in its black well. It is the most diabolical riddle of all.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Absence diminishes little passions and increases great ones, as wind extinguishes candles and fans a fire.&quot; -Walt Whitman
<br />

<br />
Yes, you are certain Walt Whitman said that. One hundred percent positive.
<br />

<br />
You have a feeling it's going to be a long day.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001983">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001984">"John: Leave a surprise for the mailman."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
N...
<br />

<br />
No!<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001985">"John: See if your father left the mail in the car."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The door is locked and your DAD has the CAR KEYS. You peer in through the driver's side window.
<br />

<br />
You don't see any mail, but you do see a GREEN PACKAGE. There is also something underneath it that looks like a slip of paper. 
<br />

<br />
Could these items have come in the mail? You don't see anything else that's usually in the mail, like bills and coupons. Maybe your DAD forgot to take this stuff inside.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001986">"John: Spy in the kitchen."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You try to get a gander through the KITCHEN WINDOW, but you can't see a whole lot! It seems your DAD has been doing so much baking, the glass has steamed up.
<br />

<br />
God he is so weird.
<br />

<br />
But you can see what's on the table just beside the window. It looks like the mail is there! Included among it is a RED PACKAGE, some BILLS, your DAD'S PDA, and an envelope that appears to be suspiciously labeled with the SBURB LOGO. Could it be???
<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, the window is locked.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001987">"John: Go back into the kitchen."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You have no other choice. You are going in. 
<br />

<br />
CLEVER DISGUISE, it's time to work your magic.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/27/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001988">"[S] John: Enter."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/27/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001989">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your DAD sees right through your costume! You don't know what you were even thinking with this foolish ruse!!!
<br />

<br />
You unequip the CLEVER DISGUISE. Your DAD wields a dreaded ARTIFACT OF CONFECTION. He stands between you and the mail.
<br />

<br />
There is only one way to settle this.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/28/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001990">"[S] STRIFE!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001991">"John: Retrieve the package and flee to your room!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You cannot ABSCOND! This pesky GUARDIAN is blocking your path! You will need to engineer some sort of distraction.
<br />

<br />
And now he brandishes yet another ARTIFACT OF CONFECTION! The man is ruthless. 
<br />

<br />
You'd better brace for impact in the most comedically striking fashion possible.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001992">"John: Equip disguise for defense."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The BEAGLE AEGIS absorbs the brunt of the treat. Looks like DAD will enjoy the prankster's gambit on that exchange, as is usually the case.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001993">"John: Captachalogue pie tin."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You take PIE TIN and unequip the BEAGLE PUSS.
<br />

<br />
Everything in your SYLLADEX is pushed back a card. The SMOKE PELLETS are ejected from the deck.
<br />

<br />
Yes! This could be just the distraction you were...<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001994">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Nothing happens.
<br />

<br />
What a huge letdown.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001995">"John: Take the cake!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
&quot;When two great forces oppose each other, the victory will go to the one that knows how to yield.&quot; -Oscar Wilde
<br />

<br />
Wise words by a man who likely could resist everything but temptation.
<br />

<br />
The CAKE forces COLONEL SASSACRE'S TEXT out of your SYLLADEX.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001996">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Sassacre you beautiful bastard. 
<br />

<br />
Now's your chance!!!<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001997">"John: Abscond."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Now that DAD is busy placating the SMOKE DETECTOR, you can safely sneak away.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001998">"John: Take PDA."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You snag your DAD'S PDA. Maybe later you'll switch the background image to something hilarious as a prank. Besides, it may come in handy later.
<br />

<br />
Your spare CAPTCHALOGUE CARD is forced out of the SYLLADEX, and consequently integrated with the deck. You now have five cards to work with.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=001999">"John: Take package."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This RED PACKAGE is addressed to you.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002000">"John: Take envelope."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You got the SBURB BETA!!!<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002001">"John: Exit kitchen."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/01/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002002">"John: Get cake on couch."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You captchalogue the CAKE on the couch, expelling the PIE TIN from the bottom card.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/01/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002003">"John: Combine the cakes to make a double decker cake."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You then merge the two CAKES across all five cards.
<br />

<br />
Everything in your SYLLADEX is smushed between the CAKES. Why don't you think these things through first??<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/02/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002004">"John: Retreat upstairs!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You pause at the juncture and head down the hall. You are going to need something to clean up the mess you are about to make by dissecting this CAKE.
<br />

<br />
To the left is the BATHROOM. To the right is your DAD'S ROOM. It is locked, and you are forbidden from ever entering. He has secrets.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/02/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002005">"John: Go to bathroom and grab a towel."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You enter the BATHROOM. You can see your BACK YARD from the window. The jewel in its crown is the SWING SET which has provided you with years of joy. There is also a SPRING-MOUNTED POGO-RIDE, which has been responsible for more than one painful injury, and has provided you with years of lament.
<br />

<br />
On the sink is your DAD'S RAZOR. On the rack to the side is a FRESH TOWEL.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/02/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002006">"John: Remove PDA, envelope and package from cake."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You take the RAZOR and use it to perform surgery on the CAKE.
<br />

<br />
You take the TOWEL and clean off the extracted goods.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/02/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002007">"John: Retrieve your items."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The items force the MANHANDLED CAKE into the TOILET.
<br />

<br />
And just like that, your SYLLADEX is full again. God this thing is annoying.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/02/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002008">"John: Go to bedroom."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002009">"John: Admire &quot;Failure to Launch&quot; poster."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You're not usually into chick-flicks, but Matthew McConaughey's cool charisma could salvage any heap of smoldering wreckage. 
<br />

<br />
This is your &quot;McConaughey Wall&quot;, a casual shrine to an amazing actor. The film above that one is a lot better, you think.
<br />

<br />
CAN YOU SEE HER? I WANT YOU TO PICTURE THAT LITTLE GIRL. [chokes up] NOW IMAGINE SHE'S WHITE. 
<br />

<br />
You got us Matthew! Your smooth talking exposed our latent racism! Damn you are good!<br><br><br>

 <b> 05/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002011">"John: Open browser and go to mspaintadventures.com"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You decide to space out on the computer for a while before doing anything important.
<br />

<br />
You open the TYPHEUS web browser and direct it to what is indisputably the most amazing website ever created.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002012">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

The new adventure is ok, but you're not sure if you like it as much as the last one.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/05/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002013">"John: Install the Sburb beta."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You decide it's time for less meta, and more beta.
<br />

<br />
You insert the CD and install the SBURB BETA.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/05/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002014">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
What the fuck is this.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/05/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002015">"John: Bone up on data structures."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You go to your CLOSET, where you keep a lot of clothes and an array of handy COMPUTER PROGRAMMING GUIDES.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/05/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002016">"John: Read Data Structures book."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You're not sure you really want to dig into this huge tome. It looks really boring. And kind of ornery.
<br />

<br />
Maybe you'll just check out that free modus instead.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/05/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002017">"John: Get free Fetch Modus."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You turn to the back inside cover, where a free FETCH MODUS is included in a plastic sleeve.
<br />

<br />
This one is dictated by the logic of a QUEUE DATA STRUCTURE, operating on a &quot;First In, First Out&quot; method, rather than a &quot;First In, Last Out&quot; method of a STACK.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/05/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002018">"John: Apply Fetch Modus to Sylladex."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Items captchalogued in your SYLLADEX are no longer immediately accessible. You can only use the item on the bottom card, and must wait for items on upper cards to be pushed back to it.
<br />

<br />
For instance, the RED PACKAGE is now inaccessible. You can only use the RAZOR at the moment.
<br />

<br />
This modus doesn't strike you as a significant upgrade to your previous one. In fact, it almost seems more inconvenient. You figure you might as well give it a chance though.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/06/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002019">"John: Switch back to Stack Modus."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You suddenly wonder if this is even possible. You don't even remember if you ever had a physical card for the STACK MODUS.
<br />

<br />
You find this all to be a little abstract and you'd prefer not to think about it too much.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/06/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002020">"John: Put down razor."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Put it...
<br />

<br />
Down?
<br />

<br />
...
<br />

<br />
You're not quite sure you understand.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/06/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002021">"John: Pick up two items."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You captchalogue one of the CAKES.
<br />

<br />
You've finally found a use for all these loitering pastries: DEAD WEIGHT.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/06/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002022">"John: Get other cake."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The second CAKE causes the RAZOR to launch out the front of your SYLLADEX.
<br />

<br />
Oh good lord. 
<br />

<br />
THAT BEAUTIFUL FACE.
<br />

<br />
You wish the RAZOR would have failed to launch.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/06/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002023">"John: Get more stuff."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You open your MAGIC CHEST and captchalogue one of your favorite books of all time, WISE GUY BY MIKE CAVENEY.
<br />

<br />
There goes the FRESH TOWEL.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/06/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002024">"John: Might as well grab those cuffs."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You take the TRICK HANDCUFFS, expelling the PDA like a bullet.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/06/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002025">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Oh God dammit.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/07/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002026">"John: Open up that package!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You examine the package. It is from one of your internet chums.
<br />

<br />
It's bound in packing tape though. You'll need something sharp to open it. 
<br />

<br />
Ah, of course! The RAZOR! It's all so simple, you wonder why you didn't...<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/07/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002027">"John: Get razor."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/07/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002028">"John: Pick up package again."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Let's take this from the top.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/07/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002029">"John: Captchalogue glass shards."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You take three GLASS SHARDS in quick succession and duck for cover.
<br />

<br />
Your SYLLADEX rains devastation on your room from above.
<br />

<br />
And now that your cards are packed with glass, you probably don't want to do that again any time soon.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/07/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002030">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You should probably go get that stuff before you forget.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/08/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002031">"John: Use the razor on the red package."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You open the package. There is something suspicious inside. 
<br />

<br />
Something suspiciously dirty and smelly.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/08/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002032">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It is a STUFFED BUNNY. Much like the one <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scraps/dontmoveorthebunnygetsit.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink">held hostage</a> briefly by Malkovich's Cyrus &quot;The Virus&quot; while taunting hard-luck protagonist Cameron Poe. And strikingly similar to the one scooped up from the soot of a burning Vegas strip by Cage's Poe and offered to his daughter, a gesture symbolic of a tattered exterior surrounding a heart of gold. Poe wasn't much to look at. But he was a good man.
<br />

<br />
But no, it is not merely LIKE that bunny. According to this NOTE OF AUTHENTICITY, it is the VERY SAME BUNNY.
<br />

<br />
This is so awesome.<br><br><br>

You find your missing STACK FETCH MODUS, and quickly reapply it to your SYLLADEX. You can now opt for either the STACK or QUEUE modus any time.

 <b> 05/21/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002090">"John: Captchalogue telescope."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You snatch the TELESCOPE from its TRIPOD. Who knows, it might be useful. But more importantly, it pushes the CRUXITE to the last card making it available for tinkering.

<br />
The PDA is predictably jettisoned into the yard, over the neighbor's fence.<br><br><br>

You set the ALCHEMITER to cast THREE (3) PERFECTLY GENERIC OBJECTS for some reason, expending a total of 6 units of BUILD GRIST.

It is tempting because they strongly resemble Rockin' Blue Raspberry Gushers. However, units of BUILD GRIST are a gaming abstraction and do not seem to exist on the physical plane!

 <b> 05/25/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002105">"John: Use pre-punched card on totem lathe."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You slip the PRE-PUNCHED CARD into a slot on the TOTEM LATHE. Above, the TOOL ARM deploys a configuration of chisels.
<br />

<br />
Now you just need something to lathe.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/25/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002106">"John: Take cruxite to totem lathe."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Cursing your lack of foresight, you return to the BALCONY for the CRUXITE DOWEL you left on the pedestal.

<br />
You navigate the hallway leery of your DAD, who is presently puzzling over the new fixture in his hallway.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/25/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002107">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You retrieved the CRUXITE DOWEL.
<br />

<br />
DAD just shrugs and heads back downstairs, presumably to do some more baking.

<br />
If only he knew you were hard at work saving his ass.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/25/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002109">"John: Use cruxite dowel on totem lathe."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
A young lady stands in her bedroom. Due to a violent storm, her house has just lost power, along with her wireless internet connection. This has severed her link to a popular video game she was playing with a young man at a critical moment. That young man is relying on this young lady to reestablish a connection somehow. This young lady named...
<br />

<br />
Named...
<br />

<br />
It's on the tip of your tongue. What was the name of this young lady again?<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/28/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002115">"Enter name."</a></b><br><br>

No, that wasn't it!<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/28/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002116">"One more time."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/28/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002117">"Examine room."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your name is ROSE. As was previously mentioned you are without ELECTRICITY, although your LAPTOP COMPUTER still functions on BATTERY POWER. You have a variety of INTERESTS. You have a passion for RATHER OBSCURE LITERATURE. You enjoy creative writing and are SOMEWHAT SECRETIVE ABOUT IT. You have a fondness for the BESTIALLY STRANGE AND FICTITIOUS, and sometimes dabble in PSYCHOANALYSIS. You also like to KNIT, and your room is a BIT OF A MESS. And on occasion, if just the right one strikes your fancy, you like to play VIDEO GAMES with your friends.
<br />

<br />
What will you do?<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/28/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002118">"Rose: Retrieve arms from the purple box."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The PURPLE PACKAGE'S contents are private! No one is allowed to look inside.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/28/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002119">"Rose: Writhe like a flagellum and puke on your bed."</a></b><br><br>

Ugh, what a terrible idea! The thought alone makes you sick to your stomach.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/28/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002120">"Rose: Stroke writing journal and mutter, 'My precious...'"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You would only resort to such an embarrassing activity while no one was watching!!!
<br />

<br />
These journals are for your eyes only.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/28/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002121">"Rose: Get violin."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You captchalogue the VIOLIN, storing it the ROOT CARD of your SYLLADEX.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/28/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002122">"[S] Rose: Play a haunting refrain on the violin."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You waste approximately 40 seconds playing the violin while your friend is in peril. 
<br />

<br />
Nice time management skills there, sweetheart!<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002123">"John: Tell Liv Tyler you love her before impact."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Since your good for nothing friend is obviously not going to bail you out in time, you issue words of parting fondness to dear, sweet Liv. Oh, if only Affleck could have been the one to make the final sacrifice instead of her stubborn, blue collar, salt-of-the-earth father. Then she would fall into your arms for consolation, and YOU would be the one to make the deceased Bruce Willis proud.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002124">"Rose: Captchalogue knitting supply bag."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You get the KNITTING BAG. It occupies the LEFT LEAF CARD under the VIOLIN, per the TREE MODUS'S alphabetical sorting method.
<br />

<br />
K &lt; V.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002125">"Rose: Look out window."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your panoramic window offers a view of your yard below, and the mausoleum housing your dead cat, JASPERS, who died when you were young. Your MOM had the structure erected with a spirit of scornful IRONY in response to your youthfully innocent request to hold a funeral for the animal. At least, that is how you have come to interpret the gesture in retrospect.
<br />

<br />
You can also make out a silhouette of the LABORATORY next door, a facility which likely broadcasts a strong WIRELESS INTERNET SIGNAL. You may be able to connect to the signal from a different part of the house. Perhaps if you seek higher ground?<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002126">"Rose: Get laptop."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You take your LAPTOP and prepare to make the journey through the house.
<br />

<br />
L &lt; V. L &gt; K.
<br />

<br />
This causes the tree to be unbalanced, so your SYLLADEX auto-balances itself. Now the LAPTOP occupies the ROOT CARD, while the other two items comprise the LEAVES.

 <b> 05/31/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002127">"Rose: Examine book on desk."</a></b><br><br>

This book is absolutely indispensable for enthusiasts of your ilk. Of which there are very few.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/31/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002128">"Rose: Take book."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You take the GRIMOIRE.

 <b> 06/01/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002129">"Rose: Go explore the house."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You leave your BEDROOM. 
<br />

<br />
Hanging just next to your door in the hallway is a painting of an EXQUISITE WIZARD. Your mother collects these awful things IRONICALLY. She must know how much you detest them, and there is no doubt in your mind she stores these dreadful things in the house to bother you.
<br />

<br />
Down the hall to the right is the way to the OBSERVATORY. Perhaps you will be able to connect from up there?
<br />

<br />
Your mother's room is also in that direction. You will have to watch your step.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/01/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002130">"Rose: Tiptoe to observatory."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You approach a juncture in the hallway. Beyond the juncture is the OBSERVATORY.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/01/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002131">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />

 <b> 06/01/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002132">"Rose: Sneak by."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/01/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002133">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This door leads up to the OBSERVATORY. You haven't ventured up there in quite some time.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/02/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002134">"Rose: Go through door."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The door opens to an exterior walkway, leading to the observatory entrance. 
<br />

<br />
You've seen less inclement weather before. Oh the things you'll do to help out a friend.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/02/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002135">"Rose: Hurry up to that observatory."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002136">"Rose: Try to connect!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You first put your LAPTOP down on the floor to get it situated.
<br />

<br />
But removing it from the ROOT CARD causes all the branches and leaves to be severed! Your items are dumped unceremoniously on the floor.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002137">"Rose: See what you can observe."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You're in a hurry, sure, but that doesn't mean you can't take moment to peek through the HUGE TELESCOPE.
<br />

<br />
You find a gap in the clouds. It seems a flurry of smaller METEOROIDS is streaking steadily overhead. You're not sure what this means, but it is somewhat disconcerting.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002138">"Rose: Stack laptop on Grimoire to maximize elevation."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You'll need every advantage you can get.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002139">"Rose: Access laboratory wifi network."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
There are several signals being broadcasted from the LABORATORY, each of relatively decent strength.
<br />

<br />
One of them is mysteriously and quite conveniently UNSECURED, requiring no password.
<br />

<br />
You select the signal, and reconnect to the game with John.<br><br><br>

<br />
Your LAPTOP is out of BATTERY POWER. There's only one thing left to do. Time to make your way to that BACKUP GENERATOR.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002196">"Rose: Knit laptop cozy to shield your laptop from the rain."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
That would be such a waste of time!
<br />

<br />
Besides, you already knitted one a while ago. You retrieve it from your KNITTING BAG and apply it to your LAPTOP.
<br />

<br />
You captchalogue the LAPTOP PLUS COZY.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002197">"Rose: Equip grimoire to strife specibus."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
That would be incredibly ill-advised!
<br />

<br />
There are some dark forces you just don't want to mess around with. You understand this better than most.
<br />

<br />
You put the book down.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002198">"Rose: Recaptchalogue your items!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You grab the KNITTING BAG and the GRIMOIRE, in that order. It's always a logistical puzzle with your TREE MODUS.
<br />

<br />
The tree AUTO-BALANCES, leaving the KNITTING BAG accesible in the ROOT CARD.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002199">"Rose: Allocate knitting needles to strife specibus."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You feel a lot more comfortable with this as a weapon. You're so handy with those needles, you feel like you could probably use them to filet a sword fish.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002200">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You lose the ROOT CARD in the process, severing the tree.
<br />

<br />
Hey, careful with all that stuff!<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/25/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002201">"Rose: Knit plush cuddle-cthulhu to soothe nerves."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
That would also be a preposterous waste of time!!! 
<br />

<br />
Besides, you're quite sure you've never heard of this creature called &quot;Cthulhu&quot; before. There are however many other specimens of the ZOOLOGICALLY DUBIOUS you're familiar with.
<br />

<br />
Such as...<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/25/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002202">"Rose: Consult the grimoire."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
FLUTHLU, FOUL PATRICIAN OF MISERY. To hear his mammoth belly gurgle is to know the Epoch of Joy has come to an abrupt end.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/25/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002203">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And NRUB'YIGLITH, SHAMEBEAST KING OF GROTESQUERY, WRITHE-LORD OF THE MOIST BEYONDHOOD. Hearing his melodious chirps and tongue-clicks causes one's bones to explode.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/25/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002204">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And of course there's OGLOGOTH, THE DEEP ONE. Whenever he grinds his teeth, all the children of a random galaxy somewhere will frown continuously for a nine thousand year span. He is the first and smallest of the SMALLER GODS, appointed in servitude of a vile, unfathomable pantheon of MIDDLING GODS which caters to the whims of the NOBLE CIRCLE OF HORRORTERRORS, an omniscient, omnipotent order of the elite few, forever cloaked in the darkness of the FURTHEST RING.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/25/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002205">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And then there's this strange page containing some rather mysterious notes on summoning procedures. You've never been quite sure what these diagrams are getting at.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/25/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002206">"Rose: Take items and proceed downstairs."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You re-captchalogue everything the way you want it to appear in the tree, and head downstairs.
<br />

<br />
You figure that's enough dilly-dallying. Time to get a move on!<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/26/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002207">"[S] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You wonder if this rain will ever let up. It's driven since the month began, perhaps long enough to forget its purpose. It no longer even knows to assuage fire. Somewhere a zealous god threads these strings between the clouds and the earth, preparing for a symphony it fears impossible to play. And so it threads on, and on, delaying the raise of the conductor's baton.
<br />

<br />
How you hate this season.
<br />

<br />
&quot;April is the cruelest month, breeding lilacs out of the dead land, mixing memory and desire, stirring dull roots with spring rain.&quot; -American sports legend, Charles Barkley<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002208">"Rose: Confront mother in hall."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Surely your mother is lurking nearby. You should be prepared for an unpleasant confron...<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002209">"What??"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
There's this really cool dude, ok? He's standing around being all chill, like cool dudes are known to do sometimes. A cool dude like this probably has a real cool name. But he probably wouldn't just tell you what it was if you asked. He'd be way too busy for that. Busy being totally sweet. 
<br />

<br />
But you could always try to guess his name. And if you were right, he might nod ever so slightly. That's a cool dude's way of letting you know there might just be hope for you yet.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002210">"Enter name."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This guy doesn't have time for this sort of bullshit.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002211">"Try again."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002212">"Examine room."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your name is DAVE. It is an UNSEASONABLY WARM April day. Your BEDROOM WINDOW is open to let some air in, and your FAN is cranked. Arguably even more cranked would be your FLY BEATS, which brings us to your variety of INTERESTS. A cool dude like you is sure to have plenty. You have a penchant for spinning out UNBELIEVABLY ILL JAMS with your TURNTABLES AND MIXING GEAR. You like to rave about BANDS NO ONE'S EVER HEARD OF BUT YOU. You collect WEIRD DEAD THINGS PRESERVED IN VARIOUS WAYS. You are an AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHER and operate your own MAKESHIFT DARKROOM. You maintain a number of IRONICALLY HUMOROUS BLOGS, WEBSITES, AND SOCIAL NETWORKING PROFILES. And if the inspiration strikes, you won't hesitate to drop some PHAT RHYMES on a mofo and REPRESENT.
<br />

<br />
What will you do?<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002213">"Dave: Quickly retrieve arms from cinderblocks."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Nah.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002214">"Dave: Get the damn beta and save your friend's life!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This notion strikes you as nonsensical. You can't imagine how a video game could save someone's life, and in any case, you're quite sure no one you know is in any danger.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, these are your copies of the beta you received in the mail recently. You've labeled them with your name in BOLD RED PRINT to distinguish them from your BRO's copies, who labeled his in kind. Neither of you really gives a shit about this game or has any intention of playing it, but you'll be damned if you'll let that get in the way of your campaign of one-upmanship.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002215">"Dave: Bleat like a goat and piss on your turntable."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You would never consider allowing any fluid even remotely resembling urine to touch your beloved TURNTABLES. That would risk breaking them, and a world without the gift of your godly science just doesn't sound like a place you want any part of. While you're at it, you might as well wipe out human civilization with a meteor or something ridiculous like that which will probably never happen. 
<br />

<br />
That sort of thing only happens in stupid idiot movies for stupid idiots.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002216">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You will however contemplate bleating like a goat for IRONICALLY HUMOROUS purposes at a later date.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002217">"Dave: Examine closet."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This is your closet. This is where you keep a lot of your crap.
<br />

<br />
Like that BOX. And that bottle of... what is that? 
<br />

<br />
Is that...?<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002218">"Dave: Check the blue box."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This is the package that your friend John Egbert sent you for your 13th birthday a little while ago. It now contains nothing except a NOTE and a CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICITY vouching for the genuine Hollywood memorabilia which the box originally contained, and which you are now wearing to be IRONIC but also to be INCREDIBLY COOL IN A WAY SOMEHOW INTANGIBLY RELATED TO THE IRONIC NATURE OF THE ACCESSORY. You find it sort of exasperating to explain these subtleties to people.
<br />

<br />
The BOX also included a signed photo of BEN STILLER which now proudly hangs above your closet. Proudly and IRONICALLY.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002219">"Dave: Take box."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You captchalogue the BOX through your HASH MAP FETCH MODUS.
<br />

<br />
Your modus's current HASH FUNCTION resolves the index by valuing each consonant at 2, and each vowel at 1. The total is divided by your number of cards, and the remainder is the index.
<br />

<br />
BOX = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5
<br />

<br />
5 % 10 = 5
<br />

<br />
The BOX is captchalogued in card 5.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/01/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002220">"Dave: Examine jar of unknown yellow substance in the closet."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Oh hell yes. It is an unopened container of APPLE JUICE. You thought you were all out. It is like fucking christmas up in here.
<br />

<br />
This is so great. You've got to tell John about this immediately. He'll be so excited.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/01/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002221">"Dave: Take juice."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You captchalogue the JUICE into card 7.
<br />

<br />
2+1+1+2+1 %10 = 7.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/02/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002222">"Dave: Access Pesterchum and pester John."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
In addition to letting your buddy know about this outstanding juice windfall, you figure you'll wish him a happy birthday while you're at it. In your own cool, sort of roundabout way of course. Good thing you looked at that box he sent you, or you might have forgotten.
<br />

<br />
You also might as well ask him about that beta. The kid's been harping about it for weeks. It would be cool if it came on his birthday. He'd be one happy camper.<br><br><br>

<br />

<br />
You've been meaning to write a review for the latest issue too, but you've been sort of dogging it. Something about the game they're reviewing just doesn't strike you as ripe for satirical purposes.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002226">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
In a new tab you open another one of your sites, a webcomic ironically maintained through a satirical cipher vaguely similar to that of your blog. It's called <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/sweetbroandhellajeff/" target="_blank" class="postlink">SWEET BRO AND HELLA JEFF</a>.

 <b> 07/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002228">"Midnight Crew."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
&quot;You are members of a sinister gang called the Midnight Crew. Your nefarious plots are serpentine in complexity. Your schemes, convoluted. You are planning a heist in your underground hideout.
<br />

<br />
What will you do?&quot;<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002229">"Use Occam's Razor on plans and schemes."</a></b><br><br>

&quot;Spades Slick uses OCCAM'S RAZOR to carve a circular hole into the HEIST PLANS, freeing it from the knife.

<br />
&quot;You push against the MANHOLE COVER, but it seems some unbelievable jackass has parked your GETAWAY VAN on top of it.
<br />

<br />
A familiar feeling stirs. That feeling is overwhelming, soul-blackening rage.
<br />

It's the sort of rage that'll make a man feel totally justified in sporting an unnecessarily elaborate assortment of fancy blades.&quot;<br><br><br>

Even though the adventure began recently, it's already over 3000 pages long. You just don't have time for this bullshit. You'll catch up later. 
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile in the present, in a place where the present may be a concept of dubious merit, John is spacing out.
<br />

<br />
But a vague and forceful thought jolts him to attention.
<br />

<br />
Or maybe it is that bumping sound coming from the other side of the door. What is that?<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002235">"==&gt; ??"</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 07/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002236">"TROUBLING. INVESTIGATE THIS."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You've had enough of the computer for a while. You feel like you've been messing around on it all week. It's time to get your jam on.
<br />

<br />
You pull up to your trusty AKAI MPC-1000 SAMPLER and prepare to get sicknasty.<br><br><br>

<br />
Those beats were so fresh they belong in the produce aisle, is what you're talkin' about. Soccer moms be thumpin' that shit for ripeness like melons. Know what I'm sayin'?
<br />

<br />
After beats that fresh, it would be a crime not to reward yourself with a celebratory <span style="color: blue">SW</span><span style="color: red">I</span><span style="color: blue">G</span>.

<br />
Your STRIFE SPECIBUS is already allocated with the BLADEKIND ABSTRATUS! There is no need to allocate it. 
<br />

<br />
You can wield your sweet NINJA SWORD as a weapon once it is in your STRIFE DECK. But you will have to captchalogue it first before moving it there.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/05/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002243">"Dave: Captchalogue sword."</a></b><br><br>

<br />

<br />
It splashes all over your TURNTABLES and your copies of the BETA. 
<br />

<br />
Argh!<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/06/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002244">"Dave: Get a towel or something!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You head out to get a TOWEL from the bathroom across the hall.
<br />

<br />
You glance at one of the many RADICAL PUPPETS in your BRO'S collection and nod in approval.
<br />

<br />
Is there anything not awesome about your BRO? No, you think not.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/06/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002245">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You enter the bathroom. There's a damp towel on the floor you can probably use for this crisis.
<br />

<br />
You stop to pay a little respect to one of your BRO'S boys up there. Hey lil' man. How's it hangin'?<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/07/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002246">"Dave: Captchalogue damp towel."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You take the <span style="color: blue">D</span><span style="color: red">A</span><span style="color: blue">MP T</span><span style="color: red">O</span><span style="color: blue">W</span><span style="color: red">E</span><span style="color: blue">L </span>(2+1+2+2 + 2+1+2+1+2 = 15 % 10 = 5), expelling the <span style="color: blue">B</span><span style="color: red">O</span><span style="color: blue">X</span> (2+1+2 = 5 % 10 = 5).<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/07/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002247">"Dave: Search the bathroom for something slightly less damp."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Nah, you just decide to wring this towel out into the toilet to make it less damp.
<br />

<br />
It is now just a <span style="color: blue">T</span><span style="color: red">O</span><span style="color: blue">W</span><span style="color: red">E</span><span style="color: blue">L</span> (2+1+2+1+2 = 8 % 10 = 8).<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/07/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002248">"Dave: Take towel."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You take the TOWEL, and grab the BOX again while you're at it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/07/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002249">"Dave: Clean up the juice."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You <span style="color: blue">CL</span><span style="color: red">EA</span><span style="color: blue">N</span> (2+2+1+1+2 = 8) up the juice with the TOWEL and hang the damp BETA ENVELOPES on your line to dry off.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/07/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002250">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
In the breeze of the FAN, the betas jostle near the OPEN WINDOW.
<br />

<br />
This arrangement is a little disconcerting. If they fell out, it sure would be a stupid way to lose them.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/08/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002251">"Dave: Turn off the fan."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The crisis is easily averted. You can't imagine it will ever resurface later in any way, shape, or form. That beta is as good as yours, forever.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/08/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002252">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You should probably go pester Egbert again. You wonder if he found the beta yet. You also might chat about your respective SYLLADICES and FETCH MODI, if the topic happens to come up. You wonder if he is anywhere near as smooth with his sylladex as you are. Probably not. It's probably not even humanly possi...<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/08/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002253">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Suddenly a RAMBUNCTIOUS CROW flies in the open window and snatches the beta, possibly to make a nest with, or maybe just for the sake of being a brainless feathery asshole. 
<br />

<br />
You yell at the bird.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/08/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002254">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/08/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002255">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You accidentally launch your NINJA SWORD. Everything goes flying out the window, dead bird and all.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/08/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002256">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
No one can ever know about this.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/09/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002257">"Dave: Look out window."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Yeah, you can kiss all that stuff goodbye. You feel sorry for the bird, but at least you never planned on ever using that beta, ever.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, now that that bit of ugliness is behind you, you guess you can look forward to several more hours of messing around in your room WHOA WAIT WHAT???<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/09/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002258">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You prepare to descend the stairs to your living room. You are standing eye-to-eye with a familiar foe, a 20-foot tall granite statue of the mighty wizard, ZAZZERPAN THE LEARNED. Your mother had him installed through a hole in the roof with a heavy-duty crane.
<br />

<br />
Just look at that mystical gaze. To peer into those aloof, glassen eyes is to arrest the curiosity of any mortal. To behold the wisdom concealed in the furrows of that venerable face is to know the ceaseless joys of bewonderment itself. Any man so fortunate as to catch askance his merry twinkle or twitch of whisker shall surely have all his dreams fulfilled.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/09/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002259">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You find this grisly abomination utterly detestable.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/11/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002260">"Rose: Psychoanalyze mother's love of wizards."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
There is nothing to psychoanalyze. Your mother clearly has no real affinity for these damnable things. She only collects them to spite you.
<br />

<br />
If anything, she finds them even more repellent than you do. She's just a committed woman.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/11/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002261">"Rose: Go downstairs to the kitchen back door."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You descend to the living room area of your home's expansive open layout. There is the sound of rushing water beneath the floor. It tends to strike guests as a strange presence in a living space, but it's become hardly audible to you through familiarity.
<br />

<br />
There's the front door. But hopefully there's no need to make the long trek around the house in the rain. You might as well see if you can slip through the kitchen and out the back unnoticed.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/11/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002262">"Rose: View Mother's solid copper vacuum statue."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Ok, but it's bronze, not copper!
<br />

<br />
But it wasn't always. A while ago you gave this as an ironic gift to your MOM for mother's day. You even customized it with a drink holder to support one of her ubiquitous ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES.
<br />

<br />
She &quot;liked&quot; the gift so much, she had it bronzed and put on this pedestal. She even left it plugged in so it can still be turned on now and then. But never to do any cleaning. It never leaves this display.
<br />

<br />
Sometimes at night when you are in your room, you can hear it wailing from downstairs. She MUST know you can hear it. She's completely deranged.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/11/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002263">"Rose: Grab the Eldritch Princess."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It's too big to captchalogue!
<br />

<br />
Not that you would want to move it anyway. The PRETTY PRINCESS DOLL has been sitting there for months, ever since your mother got this abomination for your birthday as a totally PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE gesture.
<br />

<br />
You decided to make it much less abominable by knitting Her Majesty a new head and new arms. Now it brings a mischievous smile to your face whenever you walk by. Your mother hasn't removed the doll yet, and probably never will. She would never be the one to blink first.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/11/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002264">"Rose: Acquire umbrella for protection from elements."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
U &gt; L. U &lt; V.
<br />

<br />
You're going to have a hell of a time accessing that card when you need it. You guess you'll just cross that bridge later.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002265">"Rose: Peek inside kitchen."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The LIQUOR BOTTLES are out in full force. MOM is surely nearby.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002266">"Rose: Investigate richly colored object in middle of screen."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
That would be your REFRIGERATOR, whose surfaces have customarily served as the battlefield for a chilly siege of PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE one-upmanship.
<br />

<br />
This was a drawing you did of your cat JASPERS when you were younger, along with a poem about him. Your mother bought this ostentatious $15,000 frame for it, and had it welded to the door.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002267">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Using the colorful MAGNET LETTERS, you recently left a succinct message, which may or may not have been directed toward anyone in particular. But you couldn't find the letter W, so you just stuck two V's together.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002268">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your mother then purchased a fresh pack of W's and left them there for your convenience.
<br />

<br />
Appreciative of the thoughtful gesture, you left her a sincere THANK YOU NOTE, which you had legally notarized, and then marked with a drop of blood.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002269">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
But part of it was touching the floor, so your mother was kind enough to lift the lower portion of the document with a VELVET PILLOW.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/13/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002270">"Rose: Attach a W to face as a fake moustache."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This is incredibly silly, and you're not sure how it fits into your campaign against your mother, OR getting your computer back online to escape your doom!
<br />

<br />
But it's hard to resist getting a little silly sometimes. Especially when you are absolutely positive no one is watching.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/13/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002271">"Rose: Captchalogue W."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
W &gt; L. W &gt; V.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/13/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002272">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
But that unsightly void in the W pack won't do, nor will the gash in the plastic. 
<br />

<br />
You deposit 12 CENTS in its place, which is your approximation of the letter's value. You also make a vow to return later and neatly sew the plastic shut.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/13/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002273">"Rose: Think of ways to one-up mother."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You now wonder how to address the pillow situation. It seems the woman has you at a clear disadvantage.
<br />

<br />
Perhaps slipping a fresh doily under the pillow will do the trick? Or maybe spilling a bit of WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE on it, and then having it dry-cleaned and returned along with a laboriously ingratiating apology note? No, there's no time for anything like that. Or maybe (just thinking out loud here) you could use the entire pack of W's as M's? Oh yes, that would burn. 
<br />

<br />
But you've already done something with that W pack, and there's no need to go back and gild that lily. This is delicate business. And that pillow is screaming for rebuttal.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/13/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002274">"Rose: Captchalogue velvet pillow."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You decide to take the VELVET PILLOW and lovingly embroider a poem in praise of MOTHERHOOD on it. Hopefully you can pull this off before she notices it's gone.
<br />

<br />
Ve &gt; L. Ve &lt; Vi. Ve &gt; U.
<br />

<br />
But it causes your tree to be pretty badly unbalanced. It surely will AUTO-BALANCE itself in a moment.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/13/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002275">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And just like that, the UMBRELLA becomes accessible in the ROOT CARD. That's one of the things you love about the TREE MODUS. The happy surprises.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/13/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002276">"Rose: Head out the back door."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Ok, enough's enough. Time to get goiAUGH<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/13/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002277">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You don't know how she does that. You're never safe in this house.
<br />

<br />
And of all things to be doing during a power outage. She's up to her IRONIC HOUSEWIFE routine again. That mop bucket doesn't even have any water in it! What an absolute madwoman.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/15/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002278">"Rose: Hop over counter, landing in a roll."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This bird's gotta fly!<br><br><br>

Lousy goddamn stupid wizards.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/16/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002281">"Meanwhile, in the past again."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You're almost done patching up the hole in your window with the GAFFER TAPE. 
<br />

<br />
But it's sort of hard to get any work done when people keep pestering you all day. You guess you better get that.<br><br><br>

 <b> 07/16/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002287">"READ YOUR BOOK. STAY WARY OF THESE FOES."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Pff. Monsters. 
<br />

<br />
Only retarded babies who poop in their diapers believe in that stuff.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/19/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002288">"[S] Rose: Youth roll right out the front door."</a></b><br><br>

<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/20/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002289">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It looks like MOM has satisfied her [S] STRIFE! quota for the day. She simply returns to her housework. 
<br />

<br />
No point in going out the front door anymore. Might as well head out the back, like you originally planned.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/20/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002290">"Rose: First, be the pony. Second, trample Mom."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You can't be this stupid pony, and frankly you can't imagine why anyone would want to!
<br />

<br />
But you give the pony a begrudging pat on the snout anyway.
<br />

<br />
Her name is MAPLEHOOF.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/20/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002291">"JOHN TURN AROUND!!!!!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You're TRYING to read, ok? This book is already unpleasant enough as it is without weird voices in your head nagging you to do things.
<br />

<br />
Besides, I thought we already agreed there's no such thing as monsters.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/22/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002292">"==&gt;!!!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Fine, you'll interrupt your reading and turn around, but you don't see what could possibly be so oh my god it's a monster.<br><br><br>

 <b> 07/23/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002294">"Rose: Exit."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You leave through the back door. 
<br />

<br />
Nearby is the TRANSFORMER which distributes electricity from the UNDERGROUND GENERATOR powered by the river flowing beneath your house. 
<br />

<br />
The transformer was struck by lightning though, and no longer works. You wonder if your mother has any plans to have it fixed. You guess she'd rather just play her mind games in a dark house like a weirdo.
<br />

<br />
You can see the MAUSOLEUM and the PORTABLE GENERATOR across your back yard. You're almost there.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/23/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002295">"Rose: Use umbrella."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 07/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002298">"Rose: Forget the W and make haste to the mausoleum."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 07/27/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002305">"NOW EXULT. VICTORY, SPOILS ARE YOURS."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The amazing victory allows you to scale the first two ACHIEVEMENT RUNGS on your ECHELADDER. You are now a PLUCKY TOT, with a new feather in your cap to show for it.
<br />

<br />
The ECHELADDER rewards your bold ascent with 125 BOONDOLLARS. You waste little time in storing them in your CERAMIC PORKHOLLOW.
<br />

<br />
Additionally, climbing the rungs has boosted your GEL VISCOSITY and CACHE LIMIT.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/27/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002306">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
By expanding your CACHE LIMIT, you've made room for all that nice grist you just collected. You now have 32 fragments of BUILD GRIST, and 10 fragments of SHALE.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/27/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002307">"WHAT ABOUT THAT CARD."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It seems the SHALE IMP had allocated the BUNNY to its STRIFE SPECIBUS.
<br />

<br />
Sort of a stupid thing to use for a weapon, but you might as well grab it, and stick the BUNNY in your STRIFE DECK while you're at it. It will at the very least be safer there.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/27/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002308">"OK."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You group the two SPECIBI in your STRIFE PORTFOLIO. 
<br />

<br />
No self-respecting strifer would be caught dead without one.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/28/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002309">"GATHER THE SCATTERED BITS OF YOUR LARGE HAMMER."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Oddly enough, it seems breaking the SLEDGEHAMMER altered the ABSTRATUS from HAMMERKIND to HANDLEKIND, even going as far as expelling the head of your smaller HAMMER from your deck to force compliance. You didn't even notice in the heat of the battle.
<br />

<br />
You grab the SLEDGEHAMMER HANDLE, expelling the useless HARLEQUIN FIGURINE.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/28/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002310">"NOW REPAIR THE HAMMER."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You merge the SLEDGEHAMMER HEAD with its HANDLE, and return it to your STRIFE DECK, repairing the HAMMERKIND ABSTRATUS in the process. 
<br />

<br />
The smaller HAMMER HANDLE is ejected from the deck, since of course handles of any sort no longer belong in there. Obviously.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/28/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002311">"FINE. NOW WHAT"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Dave is pestering you. But you don't have time to deal with his nonsense right now. 
<br />

<br />
Something is amiss in your room. You can't quite put your finger on it...<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/28/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002312">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/28/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002313">"Rose: Hurry and activate the generator!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You fire up the GENERATOR and drag a cord into the MAUSOLEUM.
<br />

<br />
It of course would be foolish to run the GENERATOR inside a confined space. GENERATOR SAFETY is everyone's business.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/28/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002314">"Rose: Defile tomb."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Sorry, Jaspers. Have to make space for the LAPTOP.
<br />

<br />
Besides, your final resting place is already a mockery. You should have decomposed years ago under a bed of petunias like a normal cat. Not given to a taxidermist and fitted with a tiny, custom-tailored suit, and then stuffed in a coffin built for infants.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002315">"Rose: Plug in your laptop."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You plug in your LAPTOP and connect to the internet signal again.
<br />

<br />
Everything predictably falls out of your SYLLADEX, but you're not about to get bent out of shape about it. You have bigger fish to fry.
<br />

<br />
Looks like Dave noticed you're back online. He pesters you like clockwork.

<br />
Dude, that bird is long gone. It probably won't last long in this heat anyway.
<br />

<br />
You don't even know what's up with this sick heat. The sun threatens to set but won't step off. It's staring you down, like the big red eye of a hot needle skipping on a groove its tracing 'round the earth. While lingering in midair its heat seems to suspend time itself, stretching it like warped vinyl. It's meant to rain this season but there ain't been a drop in sight. Even a little drizzle would help. Might help to fizzle this sizzle a little bizzle, set the record straight on this global turn-tizzle.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Sorry little dude, coming through. Gotta put you down for a bit.
<br />

<br />
You figure you've left him hanging long enough.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/09/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002346">"Dave: Hastily enter the room with wild abandon."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You barge in and see a familiar face. A friendly face.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/09/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002347">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You stand in the living room. Your BRO spends most of his days in here. At night he crashes on the FUTON over there. You don't see him anywhere though.
<br />

<br />
There's the PUPPET CHEST he stores LIL' CAL in when he takes him out on gigs. But when he's home he usually leaves CAL on display somewhere. And with good reason cause CAL is totally sweet. 
<br />

<br />
So sweet.
<br />

<br />
Man.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/09/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002348">"Dave: Pity da fool."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It's your brother's MR. T PUPPET, which of course is kept in the apartment with a sense of profound humorous irony. But as usual with your BRO's exploits, this is no ordinary irony, or anything close to a pedestrian TIER 1 IRONIC GESTURE which is a meager single step removed from sincerity. This is like ten levels of irony removed from the original joke. It might have been funny like eight years ago to joke about Mr. T and how he was sort of lame, but that was the very thing that made him awesome and badass, and that his awesomeness was also sort of the joke. But in this case, the joke is the joke, and that degree of irony itself is ALSO the joke, and so on. 
<br />

<br />
Only highly adept satirical ninjas like you and your BRO can appreciate stuff like this. It's cool taking stuff that other people think is funny but you know really isn't, and making it funny again by adding subtle strata of irony which are utterly undetectable to the untrained eye.
<br />

<br />
Also, for good measure, Mr. T is wearing a LEATHER THONG and handcuffed to a pantsless CHUCK NORRIS PUPPET. 
<br />

<br />
God you hope you can be as good as your BRO at this some day. You'd never tell him that though.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/09/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002349">"Dave: Find Lil' Cal and give fistbumps."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
CAL's nowhere in sight. All you see is a bunch of your BRO's weird nude puppets strewn around haphazardly.
<br />

<br />
You...
<br />

<br />
You guess these things are kinda cool. 
<br />

<br />
Sort of...<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/09/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002350">"Dave: Play a game on the Xbox."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It looks like your BRO was playing. It's not like him to leave in the middle of some totally intense gaming.
<br />

<br />
Not like him to misplace CAL either... man you hope the little guy's alright.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/09/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002351">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

 <b> 08/09/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002352">"Dave: Resist great urge to play Bro's Xbox."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You fail to resist the urge. 
<br />

<br />
You start thrashing up stunts something uncannybrutal on your quest for &quot;MAD SNACKS YO&quot; and get this way rude hunger under control. Shit is basically flying off the hook. It's like shit wants nothing to do with that hook. The hook is dead to that shit.
<br />

<br />
But you get stuck in some poorly modeled 3D fixture or something. Like a railing or a piece of the wall? You'll have to reset.
<br />

<br />
Fuck this shit.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/09/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002353">"Dave: Give Lil' Cal a bro fistbump."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 08/09/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002355">"Dave: Check out your BRO's sweet gear."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your BRO has so much sweet gear it's hard to keep up with it all sometimes. Here's his computer setup. He's usually got a lot of stuff cooking on here at any given moment.
<br />

<br />
Since he's not around you might as well sneak a peep.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/10/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002356">"Dave: Look at your brother's computer."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your BRO's computer is password protected of course to protect all the incredible top secret shit he's got on the burners.
<br />

<br />
Of course you know what the password is, and he knows you know it, and you're both cool with that because the password is the most awesome thing it can be.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/10/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002357">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You enter the password. On the desktop is a hodgepodge of unnamed folders to store all the stuff he's working on. No one can decipher his organization system but him.
<br />

<br />
He also tends to use the application COMPLETE BULLSHIT to keep up with the ludicrous amount of websites and news feeds he monitors to stay hip to the scene.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/10/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002358">"Dave: Open Complete Bullshit."</a></b><br><br>

<br />

 <b> 08/11/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002359">"Dave: Check if Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff has a sweet update."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your BRO keeps up with your projects in his aggregator, just like you keep up with his. He's tuned into your various blogs, and of course SWEET BRO AND HELLA JEFF.
<br />

<br />
You navigate to the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/sweetbroandhellajeff/?cid=006.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink">LATEST COMIC</a> in one of the many BULLSHIT FEEDBANDS.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002360">"Dave: Mouse over the orange stripe containing PlushRump."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Another one of your BRO's many ironic websites. The difference here is he rakes in thousands of dollars a month through this enterprise.
<br />

<br />
SMUPPETS are a multi-billion dollar a year enterprise, and it's awfully hard to resist taking a firm squeeze from the plump udder of that cash cow.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002361">"Dave: Stop wasting time and look for Bro's beta."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You guess you've messed around on his computer long enough. Better get a move on before it's too late for Rose, or worse yet, your BRO catches you.
<br />

<br />
But my God... the rumps. They are transfixing.
<br />

<br />
You know this is ironic and all, and your BRO reaches echelons of irony you could only dream of daring to fathom. But on rare occasions, when your guard is down, it all seems just a tad unsettling to you.<br><br><br>

<br />
You flip over the top card containing your POGO RIDE. Any time you captchalogue something, a new code appears on the back of the card. You've always wondered what the code was for. 
<br />

<br />
Damn these things are hard to read. But then, you've never really found any reason to decipher them. 
<br />

<br />
Until now, perhaps?<br><br><br>

 <b> 08/23/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002425">"John: Enter captcha code as seen on back of pogo ride card."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You enter the code &quot;DQMmJLeK&quot; into the KEYBOARD. At least you think that's what the code is.

The red light switches off. A green light begins blinking.<br><br><br>

<br />
In the interest of due diligence, you enter the other code and repeat the process with that card too.

Both cards are now punched with different hole patterns.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/23/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002428">"John: Attempt to retrieve pogo from card."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Uh oh. It looks like it's trapped now. You don't see how you can access the item anymore, or store a new item there for that matter. These cards are pretty much useless now, and the items they contain are toast!
<br />

<br />
But maybe all is not lost. Recalling from your experience with the PRE-PUNCHED CARD, you may be able to use the cards to replicate the items in question.

 <b> 08/23/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002429">"John: Mash keys heedlessly."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Not quite through with your cowboy empiricism just yet, you mash at the KEYBOARD to generate a random code.
<br />

You enter &quot;dskjhsdk&quot;. The DESIGNIX stops you after eight characters, which appears to be the maximum length for a code. The green light goes on, signaling its readiness for a card.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/23/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002430">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You figure you might as well burn the SHAVING CREAM since the product is not exactly at a premium in your household. You also figure you might as well merge the two cans on to one card.
<br />

<br />
You're a little sad that your DAD isn't around for this. You have a feeling he would get a real kick out of the idea of duplicating more SHAVING CREAM.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/23/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002431">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You punch the card with a pattern that is in no way related to the code for the item it contains. This should make for an interesting experiment.

Unfortunately, you just burned another card in the process. Your deck is really dwindling now. Maybe you should have thought this through a little better.

On the plus side, you just freed up your PDA, which is overflowing with the pent-up chatter of anxious pesterers.<br><br><br>

 <b> 08/27/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002442">"John: Collect grist, examine safe."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You swoop up the bountiful supply of grist generated by your co-player's recent exploits. From now on it will probably go without saying that you'll nab any grist lying around without making a big fuss over it.
<br />

<br />
You check out the busted SAFE, which has made a noble sacrifice in battle. Some of your father's odds and ends have spilled out, including some old NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS, and two rather hefty TOMES. It's a fair bet that these books comprised at least half the weight of the safe.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/27/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002443">"John: Examine family tome of humour."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It's another copy of COLONEL SASSACRE'S DAUNTING TEXT OF MAGICAL FRIVOLITY AND PRACTICAL JAPERY. This one looks really old, perhaps an original printing. Could it be the same one involved with your grandmother's unfortunate accident on that fateful day? DAD would never speak a word about it, but maybe NANNA wouldn't be so tight-lipped?
<br />

<br />
You give it a cursory perusal. It appears to be similar to your reprinting, listing all the japes and chicanery you have come to know and love. You captchalogue it, thinking you may give it a closer look later.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/27/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002444">"John: Examine contents of safe."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You take a look at the other book. You're sure DAD thought this was a scintillating read, but it looks pretty boring to you. Maybe you'll crack into it some day when you're old enough to shave.
<br />

<br />
Everything in this safe was obviously very important to your father. You wonder why he kept it locked away from you?
<br />

<br />
Some things about him you will never understand.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/27/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002445">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The Colonel soars to new heights on his ECHELADDER, reaching the rung: ONE MAN JULEP VACUUM, and pockets 9550 BOONDOLLARS.
<br />

<br />
Chump change for the genteel, aristocratic southern colonel.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002457">"Bathtub: Level up for slaying the imp."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The BATHTUB surges heroically and surpasses the rung: ARCHIMEDES' AQUACRADLE, proceeding directly to vaunted rung: TAFT-JAMMER. The tub makes off with a cool 490 BOONDOLLARS.
<br />

<br />
The tub's BASIN CAPACITY remains unaffected.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002458">"Safe: Level up for slaying the imp."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 08/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002460">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 08/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002462">"Dave: Ignore Lil Cal and find the beta."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You wander over to the place where your BRO keeps his sweet turntable gear. Man that setup is sweet. You feel pangs of jealousy whenever you walk by it. Really cool jealousy, though. Like the kind where instead of getting all worked up about it, you don't actually give a shit.
<br />

<br />
One of your brother's rad and extremely expensive NINJA SWORDS is missing though. 
<br />

<br />
You know this drill all too well. Trouble's a brewin'.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/31/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002463">"Dave: Take expensive ninja sword."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 08/31/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002464">"Dave: Exit your bro's room."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You approach the exit.
<br />

<br />
There's something on the door you haven't seen before. Looks like one of your BRO'S ironic comics he left for you to check out.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/31/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002465">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/31/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002466">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Ok, some of this stuff you KNOW he's just leaving around to get under your skin. This is obviously another ploy in his relentless siege of one-upsmanship to get your goat (the same goat you've been meaning to bleat like ironically, but that will still have to wait for a more appropriate time).
<br />

<br />
You think he knows that deep down you feel like you're still not ironic enough to get stuff like this, and this is probably some weird gauntlet he's throwing down to see if you will &quot;GET IT&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
But honestly you think this material is just a little TOO ironic. You just don't need to see this shit right now.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/01/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002467">"Dave: Go into the kitchen."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
No sign of BRO in here either.

<br />
Well, aside from the absurd quantity of awesome dangerous stuff he leaves lying around.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/02/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002468">"Dave: Transfer katana to strife specibus."</a></b><br><br>

<br />

<br />
You figure it's better to free up the card anyway, since you might need to grab some of this stuff.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/02/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002469">"Dave: Set Blender to &quot;Mix&quot;."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 09/02/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002470">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You spot one of your BRO'S many WEBCAMS nearby, recording the incident.
<br />

<br />
It seems you may have just been an unwitting accessory to some sort of grisly puppet snuff film. You're not totally sure how you feel about that.<br><br><br>

See, like, his hobbies are cool and all, and you guess he's got to put his shit SOMEWHERE. But what if you just wanted to heat up a burrito or something?
<br />

<br />
This kitchen is pretty much useless.<br><br><br>

You never really understood what Caveney's relation to Anderson was, or why he wrote this book about him.

Looks like a sort of index documenting all the known results for punch card alchemy combinations.
<br />

<br />
This could be a convenient resource as you start to stumble on more useful card combinations. But ever since John started punching cards, you've been contemplating other ways this item manufacturing system could be put to use. In particular, if you obtain the code for any item at your disposal, you think you could theoretically send the code to John and he could make it himself.
<br />

<br />
That is, if you can think of anything that would be worth sending to him.<br><br><br>

<br />
It appears to be a gauge for a large POWER CELL, perhaps fueled by some type of nuclear reaction. If this is the case, it is relatively low on fuel. But who knows how long it has been running here?
<br />

<br />
You do not care about this sort of nonsense and you will disregard it at once. You are very hungry.<br><br><br>

<br />
The can clearly reads &quot;MUSTARD&quot;, a fact of which you were perfectly well aware.
<br />

<br />
It is sort of cumbersome holding all these cans at once. You doubt you can hold many more than this. Maybe one or two.

 <b> 09/23/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002580">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You have BEANS, MUSTARD, GRAVY, BREAD, SHRIMP, ASPARAGUS, CHEESE, RICE, CORN, PEAS, FLOUR, CHESTNUTS, MAYO, HAM, POTATOES, and SQUASH.

Such bountiful plenty. And yet the delights taunt you from within their small metal prisons.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002582">"WV: Search room for can opener."</a></b><br><br>

It's an old rusted one of those red mailbox arm-swing flappy doodads, either for letting you know there is mail in the box, or maybe for alerting the mailman to outgoing mail to be collected. You don't know, really. You've wrapped a little piece of cloth around it for the grip.

As the glorious founder and mayor of CAN TOWN, you erect a dignified, majestic CITY HALL out of cans, fittingly capped off with a tome of good manners for the roof. You have given yourself a very official and important looking MAYORAL SASH made out of old cables to complete your look of authority. A number of rather civic-minded CITIZEN CANS gather in front of the building to offer adulation to their fair and magnanimous leader. All is well.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002586">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You immerse yourself in this beautiful dream as you whittle away the minutes, or perhaps hours.
<br />

<br />
You love the idea of being a mayor. You love everything about mayors, and the concept of an orderly, civil democracy. It all seems so mannerly and reasonable to you. Everyone is friendly and happy, and the city runs like clockwork. The foundation of the government is based on mutual respect between the leader and its people. It is also built on having a really great mayor that everyone loves who is totally amazing and heroic and brave.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002587">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Mayors are so much better than kings. You hate kings and you think kings are really stupid. They are petty, bossy tyrants and are really full of themselves and are basically awful in every way.
<br />

<br />
God do you hate kings.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002588">"WV: Explore west of Can Town."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 09/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002591">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

You are excited by this.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002592">"WV: Try to open the storage box."</a></b><br><br>

<br />

 <b> 09/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002594">"WV: Rescue that poor lightning bug."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
There is nothing you can do for this new little friend. Attempting to crush the AMBER encasing the FIREFLY would likely cause it harm.
<br />

<br />
It nevertheless bravely flashes on. You find its light alluring. Inspiring.
<br />

<br />
To you it seems as if it could quite easily serve as the light of...<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002595">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 09/25/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002596">"WV: Use the chalk to draw some roads."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You sketch a handsome network of sprawling thoroughfares for your citizens to traverse. The adoring population applauds its mayor's keen instincts for city planning.
<br />

<br />
You even add some lush vegetation to your city with a piece of blue chalk, because you can't seem to find a more suitable color for some reason.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/25/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002597">"WV: Lay a chalk foundation for Can Town's civic growth."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You develop westward, settling those fertile plains and claiming them for your city.
<br />

<br />
You section off a number of RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL ZONES for civic growth, arranged in the only logical pattern that occurs to you.
<br />

<br />
You color the RESIDENTIAL ZONES with your piece of white chalk, but for some reason none of the colors in the box strike you as suitable for the COMMERCIAL ZONES. Perhaps there is an alternative.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/26/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002598">"WV: Use your own pee for the commercial zones."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You cannot urinate because you have not had anything to drink in quite some time. You are very thirsty.
<br />

<br />
Also that is a really terrible idea and you would not consider befouling your wonderful city in that way for even a moment.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/26/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002599">"WV: Use motor oil to designate commercial zones."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You fill each empty square with a bit of MOTOR OIL to complete the zoning. It looks rather striking to you. You can hardly imagine that an up and coming young can trying to make it in the world would not be delighted to live in your fair district.
<br />

<br />
You are very careful not to get any of the unpleasant fluid on your person.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/26/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002600">"WV: Peel label from can of MAYO and affix to sash."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/27/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002601">"WV: Survey surroundings in search of more terrain for city."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It seems you have run out of territory for your western expansion. But there is still a lot of empty wall space. Perhaps your citizens would be happier with a colorful backdrop that would make them feel more at home.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/27/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002602">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Using most of your imagination and an entire piece of sky-blue chalk, you render a bright and cheerful sky full of clouds. 
<br />

<br />
You have decided that very closely orbiting your city is a LUMINOUS PLANET, about which orbits a single MOON.
<br />

<br />
You switch to another shade of blue and continue rendering on the western wall.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/27/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002603">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Orbiting much further from your city are FOUR PLANETS. None of these have satellites, you have decided. Yes, that makes sense, you think.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/27/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002604">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And on the southern wall, beyond an impenetrable veil of darkness, occupying the furthest orbit yet, there is an OMINOUS PLANET. A MOON circles this one too.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/27/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002605">"WV: Check that rampaging boy on the screen."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Oh yeah, it's that guy. You had almost forgotten about him and his confusing shenanigans.
<br />

<br />
It seems like he has things well in hand at the moment. He does not appear to need your help, and you have already concluded that he cannot help you, at least for the time being.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/27/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002606">"WV: Turn on the other 3 screens."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You have no idea how to turn these on!
<br />

<br />
There is no mouse for this weird quadra-monitored computer. It can only be operated through text commands from its keyboard.
<br />

<br />
Perhaps there is a special key or command which will allow you to switch to another monitor?<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/28/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002607">"WV: Press Tab."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/28/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002608">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/28/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002609">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002610">"WV: Consume several cans."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You free the heavenly brown elixir from the jewels of pink carapace and imbibe like the wind.
<br />

<br />
It is so sweet and sugary. You wonder how so much sugar can fit in one can. Whatever mighty wizard concocted this potion is truly deserving of your fear and respect.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002611">"WV: Welcome the rest into the city."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The TABS are naturalized as loyal new citizens of CAN TOWN. All cans are welcome and equal in your city, regardless of can content, and whether empty or full.
<br />

<br />
It's not like emptying a can kills it or anything. They are just cans after all.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002612">"WV: Hit escape."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Feeling refreshed and heavily caffeinated, you go back to work on the big computer.
<br />

<br />
You hit ESCAPE, which seems to minimize the action window thingy and reveals a history of all the commands you've entered.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002613">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You use the arrow key to scroll up a bit. You can't believe how much you've already typed into this stupid contraption. What a waste of time.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002614">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You scroll all the way up to your first command.
<br />

<br />
It looks like there are more commands above it. Maybe someone was entering commands on this thing before you?
<br />

<br />
There aren't many more. At the top of this list appears to be the very first command.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002615">"WV: Type =&gt; SWITCH 2."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You activate SCREEN 2.
<br />

<br />
The signal is garbled, and you have no idea what you're looking at. Some sort of filthy beggar pleading for help?
<br />

<br />
No one is around, And nothing is happening. You seem to be locked out of any sort of interaction with whatever's happening on this monitor.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002616">"WV: Type =&gt; SWITCH 3."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It's another one of these rapscallions. This monitor is locked too. You can't tell him what to do. Not that you really want to, since it just looks like more confusing nonsense to you.
<br />

<br />
You consider switching to SCREEN 4, but decide against it. You have a feeling that whatever's there would just confuse you even more, and you don't even really care all that much anyway.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002617">"WV: Type =&gt; HOME."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
All four screens activate. Together they display a countdown, starting at four hours and thirteen minutes.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002618">"WV: Type =&gt; REBOOT."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You can't! Nothing is working anymore. The timer seems to have disabled the keyboard.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002619">"WV: Be the mayor."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Enough of this nonsense. You are an important mayor and this absurd contraption has wasted enough of your time. You've got a city to govern with a carapaced fist! (Which is to say firm, yet polished, and supple as the situation demands.)
<br />

<br />
Anyway this will help you kill some time while you wait for that clock to count down.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002620">"WV: Create employment opportunities for the citizen cans."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You temporarily dismantle CITY HALL to free up all the canpower available to create a vigilant TOWN MILITIA. You divide them into two groups, marking them with distinct teams and ranks using the piece of white CHALK and the MOTOR OIL. You then organize them in phalanx across the countryside, preparing for a stiff training regimen. When you are through with them, your forces will be a well oiled machine. Chalk another one up to bold leadership!<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/01/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002621">"[S] WV: Lead your men to victory!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You waste more than four hours on this tomfoolery.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/02/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002622">"WV: Mourn the loss of citizen tab."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your caffeinated jittering must have agitated all the little bubbles curiously hidden in the liquid, creating too much pressure in the can. You speculate this is why it exploded as you nervously eye the timer.
<br />

<br />
You are starting to wonder what will happen when it reaches zero. Maybe it would be best not to be near it when this happens.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/02/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002623">"Minutes in the future..."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Though perhaps not as few as implied by circumstance...
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/waywardvagabond/beneaththegleam/" target="_blank" class="postlink">A PEREGRINE MENDICANT trundles precious cargo beneath the gleam of the celestially ominous.</a><br><br><br>
 <b> 10/02/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002624">"WV: Go outside and get some sun."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You say a bittersweet goodbye to your beloved city. It is time to move on to greener pastures. By which of course you mean an arid, sandy wasteland upon which nothing green has grown in years.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/02/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002625">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The door shuts behind you. A panel on the door becomes illuminated. 
<br />

<br />
As you ponder over the marks on the panel, you hear another mechanical sound overhead.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/02/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002626">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/02/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002627">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The LCD PANEL appears to have a touchscreen interface.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002628">"WV: Curiously prod the funny-looking spirograph."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It appears the funny-looking spirograph room is locked!<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002629">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The floor rotates a full 360 degrees beneath you, while the surrounding wall seems to stay put.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002630">"WV: Select the triangley fractal."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The triangley fractal room does not appear to be locked.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002631">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The floor turns 120 degrees and the door opens.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002632">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You go through the door to find another room. It's the same size as the other one you just wasted all that time in, while a clock was ticking down to something which may or may not be your doom. Maybe there is something in here that will help you escape.
<br />

<br />
Against the wall there is another perplexing contraption.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002633">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Against the opposite wall is some sort of CONTROL PANEL which catches your eye.
<br />

<br />
It has two large screens, but only one appears to be active. There are fields for numbers which appear to be modifiable with the dials to the right. Some numbers are already supplied by default, perhaps entered by the previous user. There are a few buttons below, the largest one bearing the symbol marking this room.
<br />

<br />
Also it looks like there is a METER STICK propped up there for some reason.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002634">"WV: Attach your trusty knife to the meter stick."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You immediately craft a MEASURING SPEAR through possibly the most advanced form of alchemy employed thusfar. This is obviously the most important thing to do first.
<br />

<br />
OBVIOUSLY.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002635">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Or it WOULD obviously be the most important thing to do if you had remembered to bring your TRUSTY KNIFE.
<br />

<br />
You feel so insecure without your TRUSTY KNIFE, it makes you want to slit your wrists. Or at the very least, flog your carapace with some sort of measuring apparatus.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002636">"WV: Look at the other wall."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You examine the perplexing contraption across the room. You of course have no idea what it could possibly do.
<br />

<br />
You adopt the only obvious course of action which is to poke and prod it with your HANDY RULER. You are quite sure this is what science is all about.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002637">"WV: Press the triangle pattern."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You go back to the CONTROL PANEL which probably obviously controls that gizmo and you push the big blue button which is obviously probably the most obvious thing to push.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002638">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You appearify a PUMPKIN.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002639">"WV: Examine pumpkin."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It seems this mysterious gourd was transported (appearified!!!) from a specific time and location somewhere on this planet you are on. You wonder if the machine (APPEARIFIER!!!) will take any object that exists at whatever time and location you supply.
<br />

<br />
There is a symbol carved on the PUMPKIN. You don't know what it means, and you doubt it will ever prove to be relevant in any way.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002640">"WV: Devour pumpkin."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You consider dining on the ripe flesh of the plump vegetable, but your curiosity about the APPEARIFIER gets the better of you. 
<br />

<br />
You try to sneak a nibble from the pumpkin nonetheless.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002641">"WV: Inspect green buttons."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You first examine the attractive GREEN BUTTONS. 
<br />

<br />
The icon for the one on the left is that house shape you've seen plenty of times before.
<br />

<br />
The right one on closer inspection appears to be the map for this underground facility, with an X marking its center.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002642">"WV: Press green button on right."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You push the button. All of the numbers change.
<br />

<br />
Perhaps these are the coordinates for the location of the center of this facility, along with the local date and time? If this is the case, it would make a useful reference point for your current bearings.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002643">"WV: Fiddle with the dials."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
One way to find out would be to attempt to appearify something from this facility.
<br />

<br />
It should be easy to zero in on a location relative to the center because you have an uncanny knack for tracking precise distances you have already traversed, in whatever units you choose.
<br />

<br />
Your HANDY RULER gives you a good clue as to the BASIC UNIT OF HUMAN MEASUREMENT. You will go with that.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002644">"WV: Appearify your trusty knife."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You nudge the coordinates very slightly and bump up the elevation by 0.5 HUMAN MEASUREMENT UNITS. You make sure to keep the time approximately what it was to begin with.
<br />

<br />
You appearify your TRUSTY KNIFE.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002645">"WV: Appearify Can Town."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You nudge the numbers a bit more and appearify a bunch of cans. This is so much more efficient than walking back to the other room to get them. 
<br />

<br />
You are to believe that time is at a premium, after all.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/05/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002646">"WV: Deappearify the pumpkin."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Does this machine look like a DEAPPEARIFIER to you?? Honestly, the idea that an APPEARIFIER could both APPEARIFY and DEAPPEARIFY things is so laughably ridiculous, you would wish someone would DEAPPEARIFY your brain and REAPPEARIFY it with a brain that is more smart and less dumb.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/05/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002647">"WV: Use trusty knife to carve spook schema in pumpkin."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
What the hell are you talking about? That idea makes no sense at all and is basically meaningless. Try using that mushy stuff in your gourd next time.
<br />

<br />
Instead you just carve off the top, exposing a decadent cache of gorgeous, seed-laden ambrosia.
<br />

<br />
Needless to say you consume all of it rather quickly. But it turns out to be too gross for us to watch.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/05/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002648">"WV: Move spirograph switch."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You cannot move it! It has a spirograph-shaped indentation, and possibly will require a special kind of key to turn it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/05/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002649">"WV: Appearify firefly out of the amber."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/05/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002650">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You release your blinky new friend. You will give her a name when something suitably whimsical occurs to you.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/05/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002651">"WV: Adjust time dial to appearify rotten pumpkin."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You and SERENITY consider new ways to waste more time with the APPEARIFIER. You are assuming she is a girl firefly even though you are not really sure that fireflies can even be girls.
<br />

<br />
You target the extremely tasty ROTTEN PUMPKIN that was sitting in the other room hours ago.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/05/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002652">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It seems the APPEARIFIER cannot appearify something if it will create a TIME PARADOX.
<br />

<br />
A GELATINOUS GHOST PUMPKIN appearifies and quickly dissolves into a pile of UNAPPETIZING SLUDGE.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/05/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002653">"WV: Appearify the grate over the entrance to the facility."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Serenity blinks a message of urgency. You nearly forgot that while trapped in amber she was witness to all your tomfoolery and dillydallying in the other room, and knows the timer is about to expire. It is time to get this show on the road and escape.
<br />

<br />
You reset the coordinates with the RIGHT GREEN BUTTON again, and this time only adjust the elevation by approximately 10 HUMAN MEASUREMENT UNITS.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/05/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002654">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/09/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002655">"[S] WV: Hasten to the exit post-haste!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/11/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002656">"oh wait"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You attempt the rare and highly dangerous 5X CLIFFHANGER COMBO, and fail.
<br />

<br />
We are doing it, man.
<br />

<br />
We are making this happen.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/11/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002657">"[S] WV: Ascend."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
END OF ACT 2<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002659">"Dear John,"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are no doubt reading this as a handsome and strapping young man! Why, the mangrit needed to lift the book is itself a sign of your maturity, not even to speak of the wisdom needed to grasp the nuance of <span style="text-decoration: underline">Sassacre</span>'s time-tested mischief. I am so proud of you, grandson!
<br />

<br />
How I wish I could have delivered this heirloom to you in the flesh. But I am afraid it wasn't in the cards! For you see, John, like you, this book must yet take a journey! Its journey will end on the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Final Day</span> of my life, and even then will continue some. Though I suppose that will be up to your <span style="text-decoration: underline">Father</span>. Perhaps he will discuss it with you one day, when he and you are ready.
<br />

<br />
But it is your journey I am writing about to wish you luck! There will come a day when you will be thrust into another world. And once you arrive, that is only the beginning! You will soon delve even deeper into a realm of <span style="text-decoration: underline">Warring Royalty</span> in a <span style="text-decoration: underline">Timeless Expanse</span>. A realm of <span style="text-decoration: underline">Agents</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline">Exiles</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline">Consorts</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline">Kernelsprites</span>. Of toiling <span style="text-decoration: underline">Underlings</span> and slumbering <span style="text-decoration: underline">Denizens</span>. A realm where four will gather, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Heir of Breath</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline">Seer of Light</span>, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Knight of Time</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline">Witch of Space</span>, and together they will <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ascend</span>.
<br />

<br />
John, if only you knew how important you were! I regret my passing came so early in your life. And yet I feel in my heart we have already met. But what I know for sure is that we will meet again! 
<br />

<br />
Until then, John, I do hope your <span style="text-decoration: underline">Father</span> keeps you well fed!

<br />
A silly girl naps by her flowers. It is quite likely that she tired herself out with a variety of silly antics, as silly girls are often known to do. She may have a silly name too. Or maybe not. It is hard to say for sure without asking her.
<br />

<br />
But since she's slumbering peacefully, it would be a shame to wake her up. You might as well just give her a name right now.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/14/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002661">"Enter name."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Uh...
<br />

<br />
I guess...
<br />

<br />
I guess her name is Farmstink.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/14/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002662">"Wake up!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You try to roust Farmstink from her slumber, but she is really down for the count!
<br />

<br />
It looks like she is holding some sort of NOTE.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/14/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002663">"Retrieve arms from..."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
THEY'RE RIGHT THERE.
<br />

<br />
IN PLAIN SIGHT.

<br />
LOOK, THEY ARE FLASHING RED.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/14/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002664">"Drop pumpkin on Farmstink."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
What pumpkin?
<br />

<br />
You see no pumpkin, and frankly it is hard to imagine there ever was a pumpkin, in plain sight or otherwise.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, that would be a really terrible thing to do to poor, sweet Farmstink.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/14/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002665">"Read note."</a></b><br><br>

<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/14/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002668">"Examine room."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your name is JADE. You have just woken from a restful nap, and as usual, you have no recollection of having fallen asleep. You have quite a number of INTERESTS. So many in fact, you have trouble keeping track of them all, even with an assortment of COLORFUL REMINDERS on your fingers to help you sort out everything on your mind. Nevertheless, when you spend time in your GARDEN ATRIUM, the only thing on your mind is your deep passion for HORTICULTURE.
<br />

<br />
What will you do?<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/14/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002669">"[S] Jade: Play a silly flute refrain."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/15/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002670">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Wow, you really suck at this thing! 
<br />

<br />
Maybe you should try playing an instrument you actually know how to play instead, like the one in your bedroom. Honestly you have no idea where this flute even came from. Things seem to appear and disappear around here all the time. Especially, to your unending chagrin, any sort of large orange gourd that might be lying around.
<br />

<br />
You consider throwing the flute down in disgust.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/15/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002671">"Jade: Captchalogue flute."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
On second thought, it was a perfectly nice flute and there is no reason to take your frustration out on it. You just need some practice.
<br />

<br />
But before you captchalogue the FLUTE you will need to set your FETCH MODUS first!<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/16/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002672">"Jade: Set modus."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
[rollover above with mouse]
<br />

<br />
You have a wide variety of FETCH MODI to choose from. You were really excited when your GRANDPA bought you this MODUS SET for Christmas. He is a total badass, even if a little strict.
<br />

<br />
You typically opt for the MEMORY MODUS when it comes to matters of day-to-day practicality.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/16/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002673">"Jade: Select Memory."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You set your modus to MEMORY, and captchalogue the FLUTE. You allot 9 cards to the modus from your deck, since that will be more than enough for your needs at the moment. The modus grabs 9 more cards for matching purposes.
<br />

<br />
The FLUTE is split up on two blank cards, and mixed randomly into the grid. To retrieve the item you must first pick one card, and then pick its matching card. 
<br />

<br />
For the typical sylladexer this modus presents a frustrating guessing game and a lot of wasted time on mismatching. But you like it because you seem to have a knack for always guessing right on the first try!<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/16/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002674">"Jade: Squeal like a piglet and fertilize some plants."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It is an awfully silly idea and is basically a waste of everyone's time. You will predictably disregard this thought and focus on more sensible objectives at once.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/16/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002675">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
oh my god this is so much fun<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/16/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002676">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You captchalogue the BAG OF FERTILIZER.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/16/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002677">"Jade: Consult colourful reminders."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You tend to have a lot of things on your mind at once, and you can be a little forgetful. So you keep a variety of COLORED STRINGS on your fingers as reminders. Each one means there is something different to remember at a certain time.
<br />

<br />
In fact, looking at your index finger reminds you that there is something important to remember now! It is your friend John's birthday. The green string reminds you that John's birthday package will arrive today. The blue string ALSO reminds you that John's birthday package will arrive today, though in a way that means something slightly different.
<br />

<br />
You are further reminded that you have some things to do outside your house soon. But you should stop by your room first for some supplies, and most importantly, to see if John is online and wish him a happy birthday!<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/16/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002678">"Jade: Captchalogue the pumpkin growing next to you."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You snap up that PUMPKIN which seems suitably ripe for the taking. Hopefully the safety of your sylladex will prevent it from being spirited away like so many of its ephemeral predecessors.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/17/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002679">"Jade: Exit this room."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/17/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002680">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make your way to the middle of the GARDEN ATRIUM, where a stairwell joins the four ATRIUM WINGS.
<br />

<br />
Upstairs is your grandfather's LABORATORY as well as your BEDROOM.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/18/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002681">"Jade: Captchalogue something."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your MEMORY modus is hardly any fun without much stuff in it, so you decide to stock up on fresh produce to fill some more cards.
<br />

<br />
You pick a juicy red CRAB APPLE.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/18/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002682">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You go pick a nice looking KEY LIME.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/18/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002683">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Then a delicious MANDARIN ORANGE. Those are your favorite.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/18/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002684">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And finally a ripe yellow EUREKA LEMON.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/18/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002685">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Modus fun aside, you feel it is impossible to have too many fresh fruits and vegetables on hand.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/19/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002686">"Jade: Go upstairs to bedroom."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You almost never use the stairs.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/19/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002687">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You TRANSPORTALIZE upstairs. Just above is your room.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/20/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002688">"Jade: Ascend."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You enter your bedroom. On this side of the room you are immediately confronted with numerous artifacts highlighting your various INTERESTS.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/20/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002689">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are an avid follower of CARTOON SHOWS OF CONSIDERABLE NOSTALGIC APPEAL. You have a profound zeal for marvelous and fantastical FAUNA OF AN ANTHROPOMORPHOLOGICAL PERSUASION. You have an uncanny knack for NUCLEAR PHYSICS, and not infrequently can be found dabbling in RATHER ADVANCED GADGETRY. You enjoy sporadic fits of NARCOLEPSY; your love of GARDENING transcends the glass confines of your ATRIUM; and you are at times prone to patterns of PRECOGNITIVE PROGNOSTICATION.
<br />

<br />
You consider very briefly the question: What will you do?
<br />

<br />
But you quickly realize this is only one half of your room, and is therefore host to only half of your INTERESTS to choose from.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/20/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002690">"Jade: Explore the other half of your room!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Over here there are yet more articles of your aforementioned INTERESTS, and then some.
<br />

<br />
Additional telltale signs of your enthusiasm for NOSTALGIC TELEVISION mingle with your assortment of GAME HUNTING FIREARMS. You are a SKILLED MARKSWOMAN, though your cross-hairs would never settle on an innocent creature, ANTHROPOMORPHICALLY PERSUADED OR OTHERWISE.
<br />

<br />
Your worktable is littered with equipment to facilitate your tinkering. For you, experimentation is not a particularly exact science, and you lean heavily on SHARP INTUITION for consistently and eerily optimal results. Nevertheless, you have still not been able to get that broad, flat gizmo there to work, which is a design you have borrowed from one of your GRANDPA'S more mysterious inventions.
<br />

<br />
You are a great admirer of his, and you are not alone. Your grandfather is a WORLD RENOWNED EXPLORER-NATURALIST-TREASURE HUNTER-ARCHEOLOGIST-SCIENTIST-ADVENTURER-BIG GAME HUNTER-BILLIONAIRE EXTRAORDINAIRE. He has taught you everything you know.
<br />

<br />
But in spite of all his lessons, it is still difficult to escape his stern lectures when you are on the way out of the house to run your errands. He spends most of his time in the GRAND FOYER, stewing in his own intensity and charisma.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/20/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002691">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And today will likely be no exception. Among the errands you have planned is to venture out to find your pet and best friend named BECQUEREL. This animal must be fed and he will not be happy if he is not. And if he is not happy then you will not be happy.
<br />

<br />
But first you really should dig out your COMPUTER and say hi to John!
<br />

<br />
NOW...
<br />

<br />
What will you do?<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/21/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002692">"Jade: Quickly retrieve firearms from wall."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You equip your trusty HUNTING RIFLE. There would be hell to pay if grandad caught you leaving the house without it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/21/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002693">"Jade: Wonder why the design on your shirt changed."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
There isn't much to wonder, really. You left the WARDROBIFIER on its randomization setting.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/21/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002694">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You may contemplate which shirt design you favor the most and commit to that setting in the near future.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/22/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002695">"Jade: Captchalogue nearest Squiddles doll and hug it."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Just before you can grab one, the powerful ELECTROMAGNETS concealed in their underbellies become activated, and two of them get all tangled up with each other playfully.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/22/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002696">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You captchalogue the TANGLE BUDDIES.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/22/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002697">"Jade: Lose interest in fauna and never speak of it again."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Oh, but you could NEVER do that. 
<br />

<br />
What marvelous creatures they are. What a daring dream, to combine the finest qualities of humanity with the elegance and nobility of the animal kingdom. How you wish you could know their world. To hear one night those muted pawpads traipse up your stairs. A low but friendly growl unsettles your slumber, and as the sopor seeps from your eyes they detect a sharp pair of ears cutting moonlight. A mysterious wolven tongue invites. Wouldn't these ears suit you? Would not this proud long snout assist you in the hunt? 
<br />

<br />
No need to answer. Words slough from the busy mind like a useless dead membrane as a more visceral sapience takes over. Something simpler is in charge now, a force untouched by the concerns and burdens of the upright, that farcical yoke the bipedal tow. It now drives you through the midnight brush, your paws whisking through creepers, unearthing with each bold stomp bright odors demanding investigation. But not for long, as you and your new friend must claim the night with piercing howls moonward.
<br />

<br />
You eat a weird bug and don't even care.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/22/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002698">"Jade: Pick up your toys!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Speaking of which, you pick up and admire one of your MANTHRO CHAPS. They are wonderful friends and are always cheerful and pleasant fellows.
<br />

<br />
Why dear Mr. Coxcomb, how ever will you be received at the BARNYARD GALA without the trappings of a proper gentleman?
<br />

<br />
Each MANTHRO CHAP comes with a number of accessories, including articles of FORMAL ATTIRE, a VACCINATION KIT, and a DISHWASHER-SAFE SLOP TROUGH.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/22/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002699">"Jade: Organize all your dolls."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You gather all your dolls into a rather cozy looking pile.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/22/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002700">"Jade: Change wardrobifier setting."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You deactivate the WARDROBIFIER'S randomization mode and set it to cycle through these three shirt designs.
<br />

<br />
The decision was tough, but you think you came to the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/poll_jadeshirt.gif" target="_blank" class="postlink">best possible conclusion</a>.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/23/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002701">"Jade: Look out window."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It is another beautiful day in your neighborhood. It is peaceful and quiet as usual. A rather imposing VOLCANO looms over your house, which has been inactive for centuries. 
<br />

<br />
Though dormant on the surface, the volcanic activity deep underground provides your house with a source of GEOTHERMAL POWER. You are not sure why your grandfather decided to draw from this source of energy when he had the UNLIMITED POWER OF THE ATOM at his disposal. But it has been this way for as long as you can remember. 
<br />

<br />
You have chalked it up to your family's longstanding propensity for eclectic fursuits wait you mean pursuits.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/23/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002702">"Jade: Retrieve fursuit from magic chest."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
What is this nonsense about fursuits!!! You do not own a fursuit. You think ANTHROPOMORPHIC FAUNA are really cute and enchanting and all, but it has never occurred to you to dress as one. Sure, it is fun to imagine what it would be like to run wild with a pack of wolves, or purr and frolic with a litter of kittens, but dressing up as an animal just seems ridiculous. It would still just be a silly girl draped in a raggedy synthetic tufty piece of crap, and seriously who are you trying to kid with that sort of baloney! 
<br />

<br />
Anyway it is not a MAGIC CHEST, it it your GADGET CHEST, which you have adapted for storing a number of USEFUL GIZMOS. It was once your ORACLE'S TRUNK, a gift from your grandfather of course, and still contains many silly FORTUNE TELLING KNICKKNACKS, all of which are completely bogus.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/23/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002703">"Jade: Open chest."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Among the FORTUNE TELLING KNICKKNACKS are these items: a CRYSTAL BALL plus compulsory VELVET PILLOW, a TAROT DECK, a MAGIC 8 BALL, a MAGIC CUE BALL, and one of your favorite books of all time, PROBLEM SOOTH.
<br />

<br />
Among the USEFUL GIZMOS are of course your COMPUTER, which you keep inside a FUN LUNCHBOX for easy transport, and a couple of gizmos you keep handy so you don't always have to make the long trip to the kitchen. There is a COOKALIZER for preparing delicious meals, and a REFRIGERATOR, a name which clearly is a wacky variation on the much more common household item, the REFRIGIFYIFICATOR.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002704">"Jade: Examine magic 8-ball and magic cue ball."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
These things are stupid and useless!
<br />

<br />
When the MAGIC 8 BALL isn't being frustratingly ambiguous, its forecast is always wrong! You have tested it numerous times with certain facts you know to be true. This is its reply when you ask if it is your friend John's birthday today. See? Stupid!
<br />

<br />
You guess maybe it could be used as a reverse-prediction device, and always trust the opposite of what it says. But that seems dumb to you. And anyway, the thing gives you a bad vibe. You might consider smashing it, but you are a little superstitious about whatever ominous consequences that might have, even if the occult talisman in question is a cheap piece of garbage.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002705">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The MAGIC CUE BALL on the other hand is said to make predictions with alarming precision and specificity. Unfortunately it lacks a portal on its surface that allows you to view the prediction.
<br />

<br />
You put both of these pieces of junk back in the box.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002706">"Jade: Captchalogue refrigerator."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You take the REFRIGERATOR.
<br />

<br />
You might as well grab the COOKALIZER too. No portable kitchen is complete without it.
<br />

<br />
You take your LUNCHTOP too, because obviously you're going to be using that pretty soon.
<br />

<br />
Whoops, there goes your FLUTE. But who cares.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002707">"Jade: Feed your friend."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Before you go out to feed BEC, you will need to prepare a meal for him.
<br />

<br />
You clear some space on your work table so you can set up your REFRIGERATOR and COOKALIZER.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002708">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Just for fun, Jade allows you to take a stab at matching the cards to use the gizmos. It doesn't present much of a challenge for her, so she figures she might as well step aside, while providing a few generous hints. 
<br />

<br />
No, no... warmer. Warmer. Cooler. Cooler. 
<br />

<br />
COLD.
<br />

<br />
Warmer...
<br />

<br />
Yes. NO. Cold. ICE COLD.
<br />

<br />
Warmer. Warmer...<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002709">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You have selected the KEY LIME.
<br />

<br />
Way to go.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002710">"Try again."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
HOT. Wait...
<br />

<br />
No. Cold. Really cold. FROZEN FUCKING TUNDRA.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002711">"Take another crack at this."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Congratulations, you advance your matching skill to the new level: YUKON HERO: LEGACY OF THE FROSTBITE AMPUTEE.
<br />

<br />
Jade is beginning to regret breaking the fourth wall for this ill advised escapade.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002712">"Ok, one more time."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
If it were known in advance how terrible you were going to be at this matching game, the author may have given second thought to preparing this cool interactive Flash application.
<br />

<br />
Look at all these fruits on the loose. Good luck trying to settle them down.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002713">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You just deploy the gadgets yourself.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002714">"Jade: Stick fruits in the refrigerator to keep them fresh."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
These fruits are unlikely to become less impudent any time soon regardless of where they are stored, but you stick them in anyway.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002715">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You take a look at the REFRIGERATOR'S rotary interface. You wonder what he is in the mood for today?<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002716">"Jade: Press the steak button."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Ok, well it's a rotary dial so there are no buttons to press, but whatever that doesn't really matter.
<br />

<br />
You dial up a thick T-BONE STEAK, which you are sure Becquerel is in the mood for because he is in the mood for steak every day and is never in the mood for anything else.
<br />

<br />
But he does like his steak well cooked.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/24/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002717">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/25/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002718">"Jade: Lightly irradiate steak."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
He does prefer his steak rare after all.
<br />

<br />
But you will not dignify the thought of turning the knob much further because you are not retarded.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/25/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002719">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You captchalogue the IRRADIATED STEAK and save it for your trip outside.
<br />

<br />
You probably shouldn't waste much more time. You wouldn't want all those nice depleted steak isotopes to settle down.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/27/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002720">"Jade: Examine the atomic bass by your bed."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You wouldn't exactly call it an atomic bass, but it is heavily customized to accommodate a high level of musical virtuosity, the perfect instrument for the eclectically spirited.
<br />

<br />
You've tuned the strings way down of course because your stumpy arms can't reach the low notes.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/27/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002721">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You switch your ECLECTIC BASS to its advanced setting. 
<br />

<br />
But you promptly switch it back, since obviously it's too complicated to play it in person like this. The default setting is your preferred mode for casual jamming.
<br />

<br />
And since you can't possibly waste enough time playing music, casually jam is exactly what you're gonna do.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/27/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002722">"[S] Jade: Play a hauntingly relaxing bassline."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/28/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002723">"Jade: Captchalogue bass."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You take the PORTABLE AMP from the WALL SOCKET too.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/28/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002724">"Jade: Open lunchtop."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You like to make yourself comfy in your plushy pile before getting down to business with your computer.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/28/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002725">"Jade: Get down to business."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002726">"Jade: Activate Pesterchum."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Hey look, John is online! Hooray!
<br />

<br />
Also it looks like Dave pestered you about something yesterday but you missed it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002727">"Jade: Pester John."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You greet John but he does not respond. He is undoubtedly gallivanting around his house in a state of barely restrained birthday mirth. He may also be retrieving the two packages and the two envelopes which you are certain came in the mail for him earlier.
<br />

<br />
You will wait a little while and see if he returns before you head out.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002728">"Jade: See if Dave left you a sweet new rap."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It does not appear so, but you just never know with that crazy and cool guy.
<br />

<br />
Sooooo cooooooool.<br><br><br>

You are now the other girl several hours in the future.
<br />

It appears a secret passage in the mausoleum has been opened.

<br />
It's getting awfully toasty in here. You gather up your belongings, including your dead cat.<br><br><br>

You've spent enough time for now concerning yourself with the future of your friends.
<br />

<br />
John will not be available until later. By then he will have his hands full, as will you.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/06/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002742">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

You enter the LABORATORY.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/10/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002748">"Rose: Look for mad scientists."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
There are no scientists to be found, mad or otherwise. Or anyone for that matter. The lab appears to be deserted. 
<br />

<br />
There is a KIOSK though.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/10/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002749">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/10/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002750">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 11/10/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002751">"Jade: Transportalize as far down as you can go."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This is as far down as you can go. 
<br />

<br />
The GRAND FOYER is still a few floors down, but the TRANSPORTALIZER on that level is blocked by one of GRANDPA'S impressive BIG GAME TROPHIES, and you just don't think he would cotton to someone moving it. 
<br />

<br />
Speaking of which, here are some of his TROPHIES now. He has a million of these ghastly things. You really dislike them.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/10/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002752">"Jade: Proceed."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You hop down a level.
<br />

<br />
Granddad also likes to accumulate VALIANT KNIGHTS from his travels. These are pretty cool, you guess.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/10/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002753">"Jade: Keep going."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Oh yeah. How could you forget about his stash of DECREPIT MUMMIES.
<br />

<br />
God you hate these things.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/11/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002754">"Jade: Don't stop."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/11/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002755">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This is your grandfather's collection of what he refers to as his BEAUTIES. No lovely lady will be fit for his collection unless her portrait has spent at least 20 years bleaching in the front window of a beauty parlor, a sort of establishment he's plundered no less frequently than ancient tombs. 
<br />

<br />
You guess they were sort of like your sisters while growing up, and you were always encouraged to look up to them. They are all awfully pretty ladies you suppose, but it was always hard to get as excited about them as grandpa. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Jade, study hard and keep your rifle at the ready. When adventure summons, I know you will rise to the task and take your rightful place among the DAUGHTERS OF ECLECTICA.&quot;
<br />

<br />
That old coot sure is a bag of wind!<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/11/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002756">"Jade: Complete your descent."</a></b><br><br>

<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/11/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002757">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You reach the ground level. This is the stupid thing blocking the transportalizer. It is unspeakably hideous.
<br />

<br />
Down the southeast hall is the GRAND FOYER. You'll have to cross through it to leave the house.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/11/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002758">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Looks like someone's pestering you.

 <b> 11/11/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002760">"Rose: Look at that kiosk."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Looks like a mapping of each hub's index. 
<br />

<br />
It appears one of the hubs was recently unlocked.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/11/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002761">"Rose: Go to the center and do a goofy dance."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
At the center, you find a little stage that looks perfect for supporting a spectacularly silly dance. Or it would if standing on it didn't make you a little nervous, and also if that didn't sound like a retarded idea given the circumstances. 
<br />

<br />
It looks sort of like the various contraptions you've been deploying in John's house. You wonder what it does?<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002762">"Rose: Attempt to plug laptop into nearby hub."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Great, you just vaporized your dead cat. Oh well. Ashes to ashes you guess.
<br />

<br />
There's got to be a better way to deal with this lousy tree.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002764">"Rose: Examine fetch modus."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Looks like you can choose between picking leaves, or awkwardly uprooting the whole tree, as you've been doing.
<br />

<br />
You select LEAF. You also turn off AUTO-BALANCE, since its consequences can be a little mystifying sometimes.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002765">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You gather up all your items again in an order that places your LAPTOP in a conveniently accessible leaf. You're not sure why you didn't do this a lot sooner.
<br />

<br />
Kind of a funny looking tree now, but your concern for structural elegance is at an all time low.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002766">"Rose: Find the unlocked hub."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
As long as you're going to plug in your computer, you might as well find that hub.
<br />

<br />
Here it is. HUB SN_LAB0413. It is unlocked, and thus removable from the grid.
<br />

<br />
You suspect this was the same beacon transmitting the unsecured signal you were using earlier.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002767">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You pick the LAPTOP leaf from the tree.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002768">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You plug your LAPTOP into the HUB, then captchalogue the HUB and then the LAPTOP.
<br />

<br />
There must be a better place around here to set up your computer. This huge grid of electronics is sort of uninviting. You look around.
<br />

<br />
Hey, what's that?<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002769">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It's another one of these ominous countdowns. You didn't notice it when you first entered the lab about a minute ago. It looks like this one may have been ticking for years.
<br />

<br />
Whatever it's ticking down to, there isn't much time. You can only hope that when you turn on your computer again, there will be a connection invitation from one Mr. Strider.<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/18/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002772">"IT KEEPS HAPPENING"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
What does?
<br />

<br />
You don't have time to humor every random thought that pops into your head. The clock is ticking.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/18/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002773">"Rose: Look around for anything else of importance."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This looks like something of importance.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/18/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002774">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It appears to be Skaianet's primary SESSION TERMINAL, monitoring a great number of SBURB SESSIONS in the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. Upon further investigation you draw some logical conclusions.
<br />

<br />
It looks like each SESSION consists of an IP address and a physical location. The colored dots on the map appear to be METEOR IMPACT SITES. It seems each session corresponds with a meteor, but not all meteors have sessions.
<br />

<br />
The color of the dot appears to indicate the status of the meteor's descent. The red dots indicate meteors that have already landed. Yellow dots are imminent collisions. Green will impact later, and blue will take the longest to touch down.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/18/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002775">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You use the panel to center on your present location and zoom in. Surrounding the lab are of course the hundreds of smaller meteors that have been raining down steadily throughout the evening. Most of these meteor(ite)s have either landed already, or will shortly. 
<br />

<br />
Centered over the lab is a significantly larger imminent collision. You can't say precisely how imminent, but you could certainly take an educated stab at it.
<br />

<br />
Just southwest of the lab, centered suspiciously near the location of your house, is an even larger looming collision. Though this one appears slightly less imminent.
<br />

<br />
The terminal looks like it can monitor any meteor or session around the world. Search filters can be applied as well, restricting results based on size, time of impact, location, and so on.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/18/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002776">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You zoom way out and narrow the search based on size. The two at the top of the list appear to be the biggest by far. You examine only their coordinates.
<br />

<br />
The second biggest is centered over a U.S. city. The biggest by a landslide is, luckily for the Earth you suppose, way out in the middle of the Pacific ocean.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/20/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002777">"Rose: Turn on your laptop and check on John."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You plug the laptop into the hub again and turn it on. It is now powered and connected to the wireless signal the hub is broadcasting.
<br />

<br />
Your Sburb session reconnects.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/20/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002778">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
No sign of John here. You wonder why the house is shaking.
<br />

<br />
Last time you saw him he was on one of the roof platforms. You will have to navigate via the Sburb interface to find him.<br><br><br>

 <b> 11/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002827">"Rose: Insert coin."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This weird arcade gizmo adapted to this setup obviously doesn't take coins anymore, assuming it ever did.

 <b> 11/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002828">"Rose: Let's play a game."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This doesn't appear to be a game.
<br />

<br />
It appears to be an APPEARIFIER.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002829">"Rose: Screw around with the appearifier."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You mess with the controls...
<br />

<br />
Hey, Jaspers is alive!!!
<br />

<br />
Or, at least he was in the past. According to the time-stamp this was almost nine years ago.
<br />

<br />
You try to move the crosshairs with the joystick, but it seems to be permanently locked on a specific target. You might be able to unlock it, but you clearly don't have much time to horse around with this thing.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002830">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You zoom out.
<br />

<br />
It looks like you and Jaspers were having one of your sessions. You weren't making a lot of progress though, because Jaspers was no doubt being characteristically recalcitrant. You possibly jotted this phrase down in your pad. It's hard to remember though.
<br />

<br />
Wait...
<br />

<br />
Could this be THAT day??<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002831">"Rose: Cause time paradox."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You attempt to appearify Jaspers. This would surely cause a time paradox, because you can plainly see that he has not told you his SECRET yet.
<br />

<br />
But it seems the machine has a safety mechanism to prevent such irresponsible appearification practices.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002832">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The PARADOX GHOST IMPRINT of Jaspers appearifies instead, and quickly settles into a mound of sludge.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002833">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The machine beside it sucks up the paradox sludge and begins some kind of automated procedure.
<br />

<br />
It seems whatever sort of primordial biochemical properties the sludge possesses is being evaluated by the device.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002834">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The device generates a fetal PARADOX CLONE of Jaspers.
<br />

<br />
The wretched creature exhibits a number of unfortunate mutations though. The good news is that it will be mercifully UNESTABLISHED along with this facility shortly. This is also the bad news.
<br />

<br />
Whoever was operating this machine in the past may have been making unsuccessful attempts to perfect the science of <span style="color: #0a9500">ECTOBIOLOGY</span>.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002835">"Rose: Have a flashback."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
There is no need for a flashback. Conveniently, you can watch what happened right here on the monitor. 
<br />

<br />
You roll the clock forward a few seconds. Jaspers reveals his stunning SECRET to you in strict confidence.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002836">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Before you could ask him to clarify, he vanished into thin air. You now believe you understand why.
<br />

<br />
However, you were not the one to appearify him from this moment. Your hand was nowhere near the controls just now.
<br />

<br />
A couple weeks after he vanished, his body washed up along the riverbank. His suit was a mess. Your mother fitted him with a new one just before the absurd funeral service she insisted upon.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002837">"Rose: Trace Jaspers' whereabouts on the machine."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You roll the clock forward to a week after he vanished. It seems there is no accessible feed tracing his whereabouts during that timeframe.
<br />

<br />
You fast forward another week. There he is, just as you found him.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002838">"[S] Rose: Fast forward to now."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002839">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
IT'S JASPERS. HE'S ALIVE.
<br />

<br />
Well ok, he's still dead. But his body is intact. Turns out it wasn't some kind of DISINTEGRATIFICATOR like you thought. 
<br />

<br />
It's more like...
<br />

<br />
AN ESCAPILIZER.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002840">"Rose: Appearify Jaspers immediately."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Good thing you finally got all this sorted out. You only have 10 seconds to spare.
<br />

<br />
Time to stash the dead cat and amscray.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002841">"Rose: Stop fooling around and transportalize out of there!"</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 12/01/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002842">"Jade: Locate and feed the devilbeast you call a pet."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Good luck finding him! If he wants to be found, he will find you. 
<br />

<br />
Becquerel has always managed to elude your prognosticative faculties. He is completely invisible to your intuition somehow, a property almost totally unique to him.
<br />

<br />
It used to freak you out a little, but you have long since grown accustomed to it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/01/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002843">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/01/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002844">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
HUH???
<br />

Oh, it was nothing. Nothing at all. Moving right along.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/01/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002845">"Jade: Retrieve the package you expected to arrive."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The birthday package you were expecting from John arrived months late. And yet, right on time.
<br />

<br />
It landed over there past the crumbling monument, a satellite to the great MYSTIC RUINS at the center of the CRATER LAGOON.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/02/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002846">"John: Triple somersault into room, etc. Stick the landing."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Ok, you do that. You are now in your DAD'S room.
<br />

<br />
Hmm... Where are all the clowns?
<br />

<br />
You spot your DAD'S BRIEFCASE beside you. It probably contains all sorts of clues, or at least various forms and paperwork critical to his trade as a hilarious street performer.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/02/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002847">"John: Snoop."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Aw yeah, here come the secrets. Get ready for some MAJOR revela...
<br />

<br />
Wait a minute. These are just boring business documents and spreadsheets.
<br />

<br />
What the hell is going on here???<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/02/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002848">"[S] John: Examine your dad's room."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 12/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002849">"John: Calm down, it'll be alright."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
So all those years, while you believed he was out busking up the corners with hilarious antics, he was working as an ordinary business man all along. He was just a man trying to make a good honest living for his son. Maybe he was too embarrassed to tell you the truth? Or maybe it was just that you'd never bothered to ask?
<br />

<br />
You guess you always just assumed...<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002850">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The human prisoner has broken out of his jail cell yet again. Attempts to block the cell door with heavy objects have proven futile.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002851">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You're going to need a bigger safe.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002852">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Who's this guy?<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002853">"Enter name."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Spades Slick?
<br />

<br />
Got a nice ring to it.
<br />

<br />
But you know your own name. And that damn well ain't your name.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002854">"Take another stab at it."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Ok.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002855">"State name and rank."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are ARCHAGENT JACK NOIR. You oversee various affairs of a DARK KINGDOM. Presently you are determining how to deal with this prisoner, who has been a thorn in your side since he was apprehended.
<br />

<br />
You view the affairs of the kingdom through a series of FENESTRATED WALLS. You have three walls, nearly enough to form a CUBICLE OF VIGILANCE, which is a full and proper enclosure for an agent of your stature.
<br />

<br />
However, much to your utter contempt, your FOURTH WALL was stolen some time ago.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/03/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002856">"Jack: Don comical hat."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This frivolous headdress turns your stomach. You'd sooner stick your head in a furnace than coax it into this monstrosity's loathsome colorful maw.
<br />

<br />
It's bad enough that your EXALTED RULER ordered everyone to drape themselves in these hideous rags the moment the troublesome human with the pipe and his child showed up. 
<br />

<br />
But you draw the line at the hat.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002857">"Jack: Call a minion."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You order one of your burliest agents to the scene. He brings something heavier this time.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002858">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your transmission is interrupted.
<br />

<br />
It seems your GLORIOUS MONARCH has concerns over your wardrobe.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002859">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
FINE. 
<br />

<br />
You begrudgingly don the COMICAL HAT.
<br />

<br />
Stupid lousy WISE AND JUST LEADER. What a royal pain in the ass.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002860">"Jack: Throw down hat in disgust."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You fully intend to once your superior stops breathing down your neck for a second.
<br />

<br />
Wait... 
<br />

<br />
What now?<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002861">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002862">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your blood is boiling so hot you could cook an egg on your carapace.
<br />

<br />
Looks like you'll have to go handle this yourself.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002863">"John: Investigate room for anything dad may have left behind"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It seems there are some unopened BIRTHDAY PRESENTS which DAD didn't get around to giving you yet.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002864">"John: Present time! Open a present see what's inside!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The one on the right seems promising. 
<br />

<br />
You open it to see what is inside and oh god yes.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002865">"John: Obtain SW33TL00T."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You tear into this thing and put a mean peep on the sw33tloot.
<br />

<br />
In addition to the MODUS CONTROL DECK, you got a bonus ARRAY FETCH MODUS. Plus another 12 cards, which are practically worthless by this point, but hey you'll take 'em.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002866">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
First thing you do is flush the extra cards into your deck. 
<br />

<br />
Ok really this is just way too many cards.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002867">"John: Equip array fetch modus."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The ARRAY MODUS allows you to store and retrieve any item from any card at any time. It seems exceptionally serviceable, albeit difficult to weaponize.
<br />

<br />
BOOOOOOOORING.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002868">"John: Read instructions for control deck."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
There's nothing to read, really. You just pop some MODUS CARTRIDGES in the slots, fire it up, and see what happens.
<br />

<br />
You start by putting the STACK and QUEUE MODI in the slots.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002869">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your sylladex now behaves like both a STACK and a QUEUE. Items can be removed from either the top card or the bottom card.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002870">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You see no reason at all not to jam the ARRAY CARTRIDGE in there too. You make sure to blow the dust out first of course.
<br />

<br />
The sylladex reconfigures itself into an ARRAY of distinct QUEUESTACKS.
<br />

<br />
Now we're talking. This is just the sort of needless complexity you have come to expect from your INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002871">"John: Unwrap the smallest present first."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You have a staunch policy of always saving the biggest present for last.
<br />

<br />
ALWAYS.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002872">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You receive a box of delicious FRUIT GUSHERS.
<br />

<br />
Could this birthday get any better? You don't think so.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/04/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002873">"John: Open the big one."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You thought wrong.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/05/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002874">"John: Fill up an entire queuestack with shoes."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Ok, awesome. Queuestack full'a shoes.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/05/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002875">"John: Captchalogue Fruit Gushers."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Dang! You spaced out and put it in the wrong queuestack. Don't worry, you'll get the hang of this thing.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/05/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002876">"John: Closely inspect Fruit Gushers box."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
So delicious. You can't wait to captchalogue one of these packs and make like a million gushers. Screw all this building nonsense! You'd rather make candy.
<br />

<br />
Wait a minute...<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/05/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002877">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 12/09/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002885">"Rose: Look around room."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Oh, you're back home. The well-stocked bar and the vantage from the window tells you this is your MOM'S room. Or at least what you thought was her room.
<br />

<br />
You decide not to be especially melodramatic about this revelation.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/09/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002886">"Rose: Watch the meteor impact."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 12/09/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002889">"John: Get down to business."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Suddenly you are feeling very businessmanlike for some reason.
<br />

<br />
You just punched a shitload of cards in anticipation of making a whole lot of cool stuff. This time you didn't foolishly destroy any items. You just looked at the codes for some objects you rounded up, and punched them on blank cards.
<br />

<br />
You wonder how much alchemizing you can get away with before Rose gets back? As if she's got any right to tell you what to do with your hard earned grist. You're the one running around here putting your ass on the line. All she's got to do is mess around with her computer!

 <b> 12/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002898">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Unfortunately you cannot open it yet! This package has an important journey to make first. You are planning on delivering it momentarily.
<br />

<br />
Good thing you already know what's inside. Otherwise you would surely be consumed by curiosity and suspense. You sincerely pity anyone who might be forced to endure such a fate.<br><br><br>

 <b> 12/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002906">"WV: Descend."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You cannot descend from the top of your mobile station. The loose cable you gathered up and tied together is not yet long enough to allow you to reach the ground safely.
<br />

<br />
You have used all the cable you can find. You will have to come up with another plan.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002907">"WV: Sacrifice your MAYORAL SASH for more CABLES."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
ABSOLUTELY NOT WHAT ARE YOU CRAZY
<br />

<br />
A MAYOR DOES NOT RELINQUISH HIS MAYORAL SASH UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES EVER PERIOD<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002908">"WV: Appearify the temple."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
That's such a dumb idea. Not as dumb as using your sash, but it comes close. That temple is way too big. You'd probably just end up appearifying a chunk of useless boring rock.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002909">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Wait, what's that?
<br />

<br />
There's something dangling from the top of one of the towers near the temple.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002910">"WV: Command Serenity to carry the rope to you."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
She is a tiny insect and cannot possibly lift more than the weight of a pumpkin seed!!!
<br />

<br />
She does however inform you of what the ledge contains through a series of informative blinks. There is an old rusty HARPOON lodged into the crumbling rock. Tied to it is a bunched-up jumble of HANDY CABLE. This strikes you as convenient! It is almost as if someone knew you would need a bunch of cable, and that you would have a MAYORAL SASH made out of cable, and that you were particularly attached to that MAYORAL SASH and would stubbornly refuse to use it.
<br />

<br />
Anyone who knew that much would surely possess a special gift! Alas it seems a bit far fetched.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002911">"WV: Get ye rope."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Ok, we just established it was a cable and not a rope, but that's ok.
<br />

<br />
You take a hasty swig from one of your DELICIOUS PAWNS and put down.
<br />

<br />
You then quickly adjust the coordinates to appearify the jumble of HANDY CABLE.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002912">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />

 <b> 12/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002913">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Oh, of course. The time wasn't set to the present moment. Somehow it got reset to a few hundred years ago.
<br />

<br />
It is some sort of present from the past... in the present.
<br />

<br />
Attached is an envelope. It looks extremely important.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/12/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002914">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You open the envelope. Inside is a letter and another envelope.
<br />

<br />
This is all highly confusing and you do not know what to make of it.
<br />

<br />
Still it is obviously critical MAYORAL BUSINESS which you take very seriously and you will defend this package with your life.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/14/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002915">"WV: Try to appearify the cable again."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You set the time to the present, and appearify the JUMBLE OF CABLE.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/14/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002916">"WV: Take obvious course of action."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You tie all the cable together and carefully lower your precious PUMPKIN BINDLE.
<br />

<br />
You then rappel down the station with the PACKAGE, which must not leave your side.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/14/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002917">"Years in the future..."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You decide to check on your neighbor.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/20/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002948">"Jade: Inspect neighbor's tower."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It is very much the same as your own! The only difference is that this one is home to a young boy instead of a young girl.
<br />

<br />
You peer through the window.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/20/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002949">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
John is of course sound asleep. It looks like he is having troubled dreams as usual.
<br />

<br />
You cannot disturb his slumber though. He will wake up when he is ready!<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/20/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002950">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Speaking of John, you wonder if he got the birthday present you sent him? Or for that matter, if you even remembered to send it?
<br />

<br />
Darn! You get so confused sometimes. If only you had some system in place to help you remember things.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/20/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002951">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your MOON is getting very close to SKAIA. You had better go inside soon. It is never a very good idea to be outside during the ECLIPSE.
<br />

<br />
Maybe you can take the opportunity to log onto your computer and ask John about his present. You just know he will think it is awesome, and it will be a great way to thank him for the wonderful present he got you!<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/21/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002952">"John: Alchemize in a 1980's time-lapse montage."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
That would be pretty cool, and would promote the appearance to the audience that a whole lot was getting done in not much time, but it also sounds like kind of a pain in the ass so you decide to play it straightup this time.
<br />

<br />
Rose has moved the ALCHEMITER back down to the deck while she reworks the building project up there. Just as well because it will save you a lot of legwork. Between this thing, the designix and the lathe, that's a whole lot of scrambling around!<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/21/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002953">"John: Recombine hammer and pogo ride."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This time instead of overlapping (&amp;&amp;) the two cards which created the POGO HAMMER, you use the two codes to double-punch (||) a blank card, producing a different hole pattern.
<br />

<br />
The result is the HAMMERHEAD POGO RIDE. It doesn't look like it's as much fun as the original ride, but to be fair it's probably a lot safer.
<br />

<br />
Double-punching cards creates patterns with more holes, rather than less holes by overlapping cards. This strikes you as a viable method for combining more than two items without whittling down to too few holes, or too many! Just mix up the overlaps and double-punches, and the sky's the limit.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/21/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002954">"John: Combine ghost shirt and suit."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make the GREEN SLIME GHOST SUIT.
<br />

<br />
Pretty swanky, but you are not completely satisfied with the wardrobe upgrade yet.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/21/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002955">"John: Combine ghost suit and Wise Guy book."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make the WISE GUY SLIME SUIT.
<br />

<br />
This is so much better. It seems there are lots of secret trickstery gimmicks concealed in OH SHIT THERE GO THE CARDS<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/22/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002956">"John: Combine glasses and PDA."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make the SERIOUS BUSINESS GOGGLES.
<br />

<br />
This is a pretty nice hands-free communication solution, and it makes you look way cooler, like one of the kids from SPY KIDS or something.
<br />

<br />
God that was a good movie. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">REAL SPIES...only smaller</span><br><br><br>
 <b> 12/22/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002957">"John: Combine sledgehammer, telescope, and Sassacre text."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make the TELESCOPIC SASSACRUSHER, at pretty considerable expense. This thing could probably pound an ogre into crudeburger.
<br />

<br />
Of course you have no hope of lifting it whatsoever.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/22/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002958">"John: Combine gushers and blue ectoplasm."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You mix your Gushers with some of the blue slime Nanna left on the wall to make a box of HELLACIOUS BLUE PHLEGM ANEURYSM GUSHERS (WITH GHOSTLY HEALING PROPERTIES!)
<br />

<br />
THESE SHOULD BE CONVENIENT, IF SOMEWHAT UNAPPETIZING.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/22/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002959">"John: Combine fake arm, blue ectoplasm, and PDA."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make the REMOTE GHOST GAUNTLET. 
<br />

<br />
It looks like when you put on the special computer-glove it lets you control the big slimy ghost hand.
<br />

<br />
The GHOST GAUNTLET appears to have a considerably higher lift capacity than your own puny arms.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/22/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002960">"John: Combine ghost gauntlet and bathroom mirror."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make a LEFT HANDED REMOTE GHOST GAUNTLET to complete the pair.
<br />

<br />
BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE WHY THE HELL NOT.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/22/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002961">"John: Combine umbrella and straight razor."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make the BARBER'S BEST FRIEND.
<br />

<br />
It suddenly seems worthwhile to you to go nab that UMBRELLAKIND STRIFE SPECIBUS that's been lying in the study for a while.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/22/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002962">"John: Combine gushers and shaving cream."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make a deadly BETTY CROCKER BARBASOL BOMB.
<br />

<br />
Be careful with that thing! Jesus!!<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/22/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002963">"John: Combine Ghost Dad poster with..."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Ok, you have a cool idea for something to do with your GHOST DAD POSTER, but it looks like you drew shit all over that one too without realizing it.
<br />

<br />
Lousy goddamn stupid subconscious!
<br />

<br />
Anyway, you think you have an idea how to clean it up.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/22/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002964">"John: Captchalogue/punch Heath Ledger Joker figurine."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
If you can somehow &quot;subtract&quot; the code of the JOKER FIGURINE from the code of the poster, it might work.
<br />

<br />
Luckily, the Joker code only has two holes, making the task very simple. The defaced Cosby poster shares those holes. You determine that the defaced Cosby could only result from a double-punching with the Joker, if your theory is correct. This means the original Cosby poster had one of those holes punched, or the other, or neither, making three total possibilities.
<br />

<br />
You try out all three possible codes, yielding:
<br />

<br />
- 1 POTTED PLANT 
<br />
- 1 PAINTING OF A HORSE ATTACKING A FOOTBALL PLAYER 
<br />
- 1 CLEAN COSBY POSTER 
<br />

<br />
SUCCESS.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/22/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002965">"John: Combine Cosby poster with computer."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make the COSBYTOP COMPUTER.
<br />

<br />
This thing is probably a useless piece of shit, but making it has caused you to feel an alarming sense of satisfaction.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/22/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002966">"John: Combine Dad's hat and Problem Sleuth game."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make another ordinary FEDORA with FOUR PIECES OF CANDY CORN inside.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/22/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002967">"John: Combine Hammer and Problem Sleuth game."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Whatever this item is, you cannot make it yet! It requires a ludicrous amount of grist, some types of which you have not even encountered.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/22/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002968">"John: Combine iron and pogo hammer."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make the WRINKLEFUCKER.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/22/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002969">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
So much sweet loot. You'd almost think it was simultaneously your birthday, AND Christmas or something.
<br />

<br />
Of course you know that is ridiculous and could never conceivably happen.<br><br><br>

 <b> 12/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002975">"Jade: Update colourful reminders."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You take a moment to gather your thoughts after your dream. While you are asleep it can get very confusing figuring out what is really happening and what isn't. Especially during the ECLIPSE, when you are exposed to many visions of the past, present, and future through a variety of CLOUD MIRAGES. It is only after you wake up that you are able to start making sense of it all, and your REMINDERS help you do this!
<br />

<br />
But on reflection, there wasn't much in the dream about the future. You were quite surprised to see your DOG in your dream though. It was the first time the crafty guardian has ever appeared in a dream! You have learned that today is his birthday, just like it is for your other best friend. You have always wondered about this, and never had the chance to throw him a party and bake him a cake. Now you can! 
<br />

<br />
But if you do, it seems that you will need A LOT of candles.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002976">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Bec has never allowed you to enter the MYSTIC RUINS for reasons you never understood. You always assumed it was on account of your protection. But your dream has strongly suggested to you that is where you need to go now!
<br />

<br />
Since your DREAMBOT is secured in its chamber and does not need to be looked after, Bec is taking a nap in the GRAND FOYER as he usually does. Perhaps you can take advantage of this and sneak out of the house another way?<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/29/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002977">"Jade: Grab your harpoon gun."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Oh yes, of course! One of your REMINDERS reminds you that you still have a package to deliver too. This way you can kill two birds with one harpoon gun.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/30/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002978">"Jade: Use harpoon to zip-line into the great outdoors."</a></b><br><br>

<br />

<br />
If you had any more APPLE JUICE you would pour some out for your homie.

 <b> 12/31/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002983">"Dave: Go get a god damn new sword."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Perhaps you will. But if you do, it looks like you'll have to break it first.
<br />

<br />
Perfectly good STRIFE SPECIBUS, down the toilet. Thanks BRO.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/31/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002984">"Dave: Captchalogue beta."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You try to grab the <span style="color: blue">B</span><span style="color: red">E</span><span style="color: blue">T</span><span style="color: red">A</span> (6) but you forgot your sylladex is completely packed.
<br />

<br />
You wonder why you jammed all this useless crap in here in the first place. Maybe you assumed you would weaponize it all during one of your customary HASHRAP battles with your BRO. But in retrospect that probably just would have been a huge chore and would have made the battle drag on forever. 
<br />

<br />
It's like what are you made of time.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/31/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002985">"Dave: Eject your modus and set it to Scrabble values."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You dump all this crap all over the roof.
<br />

<br />
You then set your modus to the SCRABBLE HASH FUNCTION for some reason. This function always makes it a little less intuitive to calculate hash values for items, and therefore more cumbersome to rap with. But you guess that's kind of a moot point now that your BRO flew off fuck knows where. His mysterious ways transcend irony once again.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/31/09  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=002986">"Dave: Get beta."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You get the <span style="color: green">BETA</span> (3+1+1+1), now yielding a radically different hash value with the Scrabble function.
<br />

<br />
Which is to say a radically exactly the same value.<br><br><br>

<br />
happy birthday!!! 
<br />

<br />
thanks for being such a great friend all these years. i know you like to make it out like you're playing it cool and don't care much about the people in your life, but i know deep down you really do. hell, not even that deep down. it's like, um, like your subconscious is having a wet t-shirt contest, and you being all aloof is this totally soggy shirt doing no good at all at hiding nothin'. oh wait, it looks like two can play at this game of cracking all these high falutin psychology books! AW SNAP!!!
<br />

<br />
but yeah, i got you this because i think you're really creative and you could make something nice with it if you put your mind to it. and it might help you take your mind off a lot of all this serious business you're always absorbed in. you know, all this weirdo pseudo-gothy stuff or whatever. frankly it's kind of depressing. 
<br />

<br />
anyway you're the best rose! have a rad 13th! (i will catch up with you guys soon. god you're all so old.)

happy birthday!!!
<br />

<br />
i just wanted to take a break from telling you how much your gay butt stinks all the time and say what an awesome friend you are. seriously, on any other day i would be downplaying how you aren't really as cool as you think you are, but just between you and me i think you might actually be that cool. i think you just gotta get out of your bro's shadow and spread your wings dude!!!
<br />

<br />
so i got you these. they're totally authentic! they actually touched ben stiller's weird, sort of gaunt face at some point. i'm sure you'll dig them because i know you lolled so hard at that movie. ok so for real, this is sort of a shitty present, but it is an ironic present because i know you wouldn't have it any other way. maybe you can wear them ironically some time. they MIGHT even be more ironic than you and your bro's dumb pointy anime shades.
<br />

<br />
anyway, have a good one buddy! and stay busy being totally sweet!
<br />

 <b> 01/02/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003000">"You are now..."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The Aimless Renegade. 
<br />

<br />
You have identified a couple of unwelcome rogues outside your present stronghold. They are in violation of your jurisdiction. Despite your ordinarily striking marksmanship, you have spent your entire ammo clip without recording a single killshot.
<br />

<br />
What will you do?<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/02/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003001">"AR: Realize that your weapon is magazine-fed, not clip-fed."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 01/02/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003002">"AR: Examine the wall behind you."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The wall exhibits rows of ancient hieroglyphs depicting an array of amphibious and reptilian life forms.
<br />

<br />
This is illegal pictography. It makes you angry.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/02/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003003">"AR: Go search for more ammo."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
There is plenty of ammunition stored in the various AMMO CRATES which you have spent a great deal of time unearthing from nearby dunes and hauling back to your stronghold. You have a large variety of weaponry and ammunition at your disposal.
<br />

<br />
Whether you can locate some more AK47 rounds quickly enough is a different matter.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/02/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003004">"AR: Quickly retrieve side arms."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You retrieve a pair of deadly SIDE ARMS.
<br />

<br />
But you will need a longer-ranged weapon if you are to continue your enforcement.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/03/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003005">"AR: Find a rocket launcher."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 01/03/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003007">"AR: Befriend the unwelcome rogues."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You wonder if you should reconsider your grievance with the offenders. Perhaps you should let it slide? They seem friendly enough, and it's been so long since you've had company. It would also be quite a pity to blow up that tall attractive female.
<br />

<br />
But then again...<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/03/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003008">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
They are both in flagrant violation, trespassing through several zones which you painstakingly marked as off-limits while you conduct your investigation of this crime scene. It is your duty to investigate this ILLEGAL MONUMENT and get to the bottom of its ILLICIT AMPHIBIOUS IDOLATRY. Just thinking about all the sloppy footprints they are leaving in the sand makes your carapace steam.
<br />

<br />
The law is all that's left to hold on to in this unforgiving dust bowl. You cannot afford to loosen your black claw's grip lest justice slip through your fingers. Law is beauty. Order is peace. Judgment is the very basis for all that is pure and...
<br />

<br />
Hold that thought.
<br />

<br />
You need to take a moment to wear something ridiculous before you continue your spiel...<br><br><br>

 <b> 01/03/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003011">"AR: Examine moving platform."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It appears to be a large stage serving as a kind of elevator. But it can't go down because there's something jammed in it. Looks like a peculiar musical instrument, probably centuries old.
<br />

<br />
But yeah, the jury agrees. You've got to go blow up those trespassers.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/03/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003012">"Jade: Place present on monument."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You put John's present down in just the right spot, along with a letter you prepared a little while ago after a particularly interesting series of dreams.
<br />

<br />
Should be any minute now...<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/03/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003013">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 01/03/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003015">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

Maybe you can think of a better way across though.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/04/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003016">"PM : Read the letter."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This is kind of confusing.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/04/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003017">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />

 <b> 01/04/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003018">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

STUPID STUPID STUPID

You had them right in your crosshairs. You have no idea how a crack shot like you could have missed. It is practically inconceivable.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/04/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003020">"AR: Be the law."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You reload and take aim.
<br />

<br />
That fair carapace... how it sparkles in the desert light.
<br />

<br />
No. You cannot afford to be distracted by such thoughts. You are busy being the law.<br><br><br>

<span style="color: #0715cd">dear jade,
<br />

<br />
happy birthday!!!
<br />

<br />
it's hard to thank you enough for your friendship over the years. heck, if it weren't for you i wouldn't even have met rose and dave, so that is like, THREE TIMES the friendship! that is almost like, TOO MUCH FRIENDSHIP. ha ha. i only wish i could get you something for your birthday that could remotely make up for what you've given me, but of course that's impossible. so here are a couple silly things anyway!
<br />

<br />
i went to a weird asian store the other day and saw this rad shirt, so i got it and i'm wearing it now! but there was a blue one too which was way more awesome, and i wanted you to have it. i know you like green a lot, but maybe you'd like to try wearing blue sometimes? i bet you'd look like a million bucks! also i know you've been frustrated lately about how your pumpkins keep disappearing. well, i can't begin to explain why that's happening! all i can do is give you these so you can plant some more. don't give up, jade! wherever those dumb old pumpkins went off to, i'm sure you know the fun is in growing them and taking care of them until they're ready!
<br />

<br />
whew, got to head out to the post office now so this doesn't get to you TOO late! talk to you soon!!!

Whoever he is, you think he might be on to something. Blue is a very pretty color! Also, growing some pumpkins sounds like it could be fun. Maybe you will ask Grandpa if you can use the atrium to do some gardening. This will be exciting.<br><br><br>

You obviously have no idea what that means.
<br />

<br />
If it's some smartass way of saying to pick it up, forget it. You are already carrying an item. It is your trusty DECK OF CARDS.<br><br><br>

<br />
What is under the rug is much worse than any trap you can imagine.
<br />

<br />
It is a member of a species that you do not recognize, with a ghastly furred upper lip.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/16/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003060">"[I] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You rummage around. It's no unusual assortment of belongings, and nothing any mobster worth his salt would be caught plotting and scheming without. Certainly nothing eyebrow raising.
<br />

<br />
Bunch of blades, some playing cards, and a variety of other miscellaneous stuff.
<br />

<br />
Also your VENDETTA ITINERARY and your HEIST MAP.<br><br><br>

<br />

<br />
But of course there is only a plain and serviceable BACKUP HAT, which naturally conceals two LICORICE SCOTTY DOGS. 
<br />

<br />
Which makes you think that maybe you are wearing your BACKUP HAT, and this is your usual one? Hell if you know. They are the same damn hat.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/17/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003065">"[I] SS: Hide inside your war chest."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You cannot hide properly inside the chest because you cannot close it while you are inside.
<br />

<br />
Instead you momentarily pretend it is a really cool automobile that commands the fear and respect of larcenous adversaries everywhere.

Is that what this thing is? You've had it for some time, and don't quite remember how you got it. You never knew the identity of this pipe-smoking creature.
<br />

<br />
Perhaps it could be the same species as the character you just saw under the rug. But you know that is impossible, because this one does not feature the same bizarre furred lip. They are probably differing species within the same genus.<br><br><br>

But if you need any repairs, you could always get to <span style="color: #2ed73a">STITCH </span>(<span style="color: #ffea00">9</span>) and &quot;persuade&quot; him.

On review, your schemes seem a bit convoluted. But you wouldn't have it any other way.

<br />
He says he's got <span style="color: #2ed73a">Doze</span> tied up for interrogation.

 <b> 01/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003079">"[I] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

He's probably still using his special ability to slow time down for himself.
<br />

<br />
He can't feel a damn thing, and certainly isn't saying anything. Apart from a very low noise which could be him saying &quot;ow&quot; very, very slowly.<br><br><br>

You begin a feeble campaign of psychological warfare. Perhaps compromising his fashion motif is the way to get to him.
<br />

<br />
Nope. Looks like he's still in his weird state of stasis and doesn't care.

Either that or it's driving him nuts. Just very slowly.<br><br><br>

You couldn't find any ROPE, so you tied him up with a STRETCH ARMSTRONG DOLL which you happened to have lying around. You don't remember how you got it.

<br />

<br />
A SCURRILOUS STRAGGLER eyes impromptu desert skirmish.
<br />

<br />
He dismisses them as a bunch of ill-mannered rogues warranting no further investigation. Although he gives a small nod of approval to the plain and serviceable HAT worn by one of the combatants which strikes him as an absolutely smashing display of good fashion sense.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003175">"[I] SS: Hit Crowbar in the head."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You can't kill him yet. You need him alive to return to the original timeline.

 <b> 01/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003176">"[I] SS: Stuff him in your deck of cards."</a></b><br><br>

<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">Sawbuck </span>you need to keep alive too, for the moment. Not to return to the right timeline, but the right time.

 <b> 01/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003177">"[I] SS: Just go stab Sawbuck until the time shenanigans stop"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You treat him to a bit of the old BAIT AND SWITCHBLADE.
<br />

<br />
You appear in the future. You guess this is after the gunfight is over. The gunfight that never took place since you killed/kidnapped everyone who was supposed to be involved. Looks like only Boxcars is here.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003178">"[I] SS: Carry Sawbuck like Titan Atlas would carry the world"</a></b><br><br>

<br />

<br />

<br />
If you take <span style="color: #2ed73a">Sawbuck</span> back to your own time and kill him there, that should save you the trouble of hunting him down. Might as well take <span style="color: #2ed73a">Stitch</span> too.

<br />
You dump them in the WRATHTUB, then stick the tub in your own DECK OF CARDS. 
<br />

<br />
But you give Boxcars back his sordid literature, which he'd carelessly left in plain sight. No one will ever catch you leaving your smut around. And even if you did, that copy of TERRIER FANCY MAGAZINE could belong to ANYBODY. No one could prove nothin'.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003180">"[I] SS: Stick Crowbar's pin back in again."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You go back to your original timeline. 
<br />

<br />
But now, stuffed in your chest you've got a live <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar </span>from another timeline. Brought to the timeline where he's supposed to be dead... so you guess now he's alive in this timeline which is in part defined by his death? Ok, whatever. You should probably just kill him again anyway.
<br />

<br />
Also <span style="color: #2ed73a">Sawbuck </span>from another timeline is in there too. So you guess now there are two <span style="color: #2ed73a">Sawbucks</span>? This is getting kind of dumb.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003181">"[I] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 01/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003182">"[I] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You deflect his gunfire into the awesome gravitational pull of <span style="color: #2ed73a">Sawbuck</span>'s astonishing girth.
<br />

<br />
Everybody into the past!<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003183">"[I] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You dodge his next round too. 
<br />

<br />
It seems <span style="color: #2ed73a">Sawbuck </span>from this timeline (i.e. the &quot;real&quot; <span style="color: #2ed73a">Sawbuck</span>) was in this room at this point in time. He and <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar </span>exchange bullets. Off they go.
<br />

<br />
They no doubt go on to spend the rest of their ammunition peppering each other throughout the timeline, destroying all these clocks in the process between now and the present. You guess that explains the mess when you got here. Thank God you figured that out. You'd have surely lost sleep over it.

<br />
Just as you hear your past self asking what happened to your eye, you jab <span style="color: #2ed73a">Sawbuck </span>with your BUTTERFLY EFFECT KNIFE. You remember a little while ago asking yourself about your eye, and not giving yourself an answer just before disappearing. Maybe if you stopped and thought about it for a second, you could have warned yourself and avoided the whole mess, albeit in the process of creating a paradox. But your strict policy of stabbing first and answering questions later prevented it. You're sure your past self understands/understood. You are sure of this because you very clearly remember understanding/understooding.<br><br><br>

<br />
Being your future self is a lot more constructive because you get to do stuff you haven't already done.
<br />

<br />
Looks like you're in the future. It's a bloody mess in here. The clocks are more bullet-riddled than ever. And it seems <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar</span> and both <span style="color: #2ed73a">Sawbucks</span> have been decapitated. You're almost certain this is something you will be, or were already, responsible for. Which of course means more time traveling.
<br />

<br />
Looks like the tub and chest are gone. Which means future-you must have packed up and left already. Got to take note of these sorts of things so you know where you are in the timeline.
<br />

<br />

He punches you into next week.
<br />

<br />
You find yourself going about your business a week later. Looks like you're doing a little grocery shopping.
<br />

<br />
You're a bit confused, having no memory of the previous week. You have no idea what is on your grocery list. Are you out of milk?? What kind of produce do you need to stock up on??? It is all a little overwhelming.
<br />

<br />
And to make things worse,
<br />

<span style="color: #2ed73a">Cans</span> clocks Boxcars entirely out of the current calendar year. You land in a totally different outdated calendar.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/07/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003235">"[I] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Looks like this one's themed with SPIRITED HORSES. You'll be up to your ass in horses for a whole year. Just great, this is just what you need to be doing. Farmin' all these goddamn horses. Fuckin' pain in the ass.<br><br><br>

<br />
You don't care what the consequences are. You're going to crack open this safe and be done with it.
<br />

<br />
This whole intermission was starting to get a little punchy anyway.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/08/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003237">"[I] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The massive release of temporal distortion from the vault transports you to a highly unfavorable timeline. Looks like the entire mansion was leveled, except for the vault and its enclosure. Everyone's dead except for you and you know who.
<br />

<br />
But at least the safe's open.
<br />

<br />
There's nothing in here except an opening in the floor. There is a door with a keyhole, and you have a feeling you know how to open it.
<br />

<br />
You only wonder why <span style="color: #2ed73a">English</span>'s treasure would be locked behind a door with a spade on it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/08/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003239">"[I] SS: Dramatically use the spade key."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You guess this is what the SPADE KEY was for all this time. You dramatically wield the SPADE KEY in a matter of fact manner.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/08/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003240">"[I] SS: Peek inside keyhole."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
What KEYHOLE? It was clearly a BARCODE SCANNER all along. Like the kind they sweep groceries over at supermarkets. That reminds you, you should really do some shopping next week.
<br />

<br />
You're not going to peek inside because the lasers could blind you in one eye. OH WAIT<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/08/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003241">"[I] SS: Use rules card for blackjack."</a></b><br><br>

This was never a problem because there is clearly a barcode printed on your RULES CARD FOR BLACKJACK.
<br />

<br />
As well as your arm. But there's nothing wrong with a little redundancy you guess.<br><br><br>

<br />
An ancient TIME CAPSULE has blossomed. You find nested in its petals a juice-stained SBURB BETA once belonging to one of your friends.
<br />

<br />
What will you do?<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003267">"Jade: Take the discs."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You captchalogue the SBURB BETA. It uneventfully tucks itself into your sylladex.
<br />

<br />
You think you're getting kind of bored with this fetch modus. You like to mix it up now and then. 
<br />

<br />
Maybe you'll <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002672" target="_blank" class="postlink">peruse your selection</a> and try out another one.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003268">"Jade: Switch to Jenga modus."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You swap your modus to JENGA, ejecting your sylladex in the process.
<br />

<br />
Looks like the TIME CAPSULE has reset itself. It is sprouting a new bud. Presumably something else will come out when it blooms again in about 400 years.
<br />

<br />
Too bad you won't be around to find out what it is!<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003269">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your modus grabs the 18 cards needed to set itself up. It divides each card into three CAPTCHALOGUE BLOCKS.
<br />

<br />
You begin picking up your items. The item is captchalogued, chopped into three blocks, and distributed randomly into the block tower.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003270">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You gather up the rest of your items. Might as well try it out!
<br />

<br />
You go for all the blocks containing your TANGLE BUDDIES.
<br />

<br />
Careful... careful...<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003271">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 02/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003272">"Jade: Switch to Pictionary modus."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Yeah, that one's obviously not going to work.
<br />

<br />
You switch to PICTIONARY, a choice based on a strong whim from the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/poll_jademodus.gif" target="_blank" class="postlink">mysterious ethers of democracy</a>.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003273">"Jade: Try out new Pictionary modus."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Ok, you start by trying to grab your LUNCHTOP. 
<br />

<br />
After you ditch an unwelcome solicitor first, that is. 
<br />

<br />
You've got to concentrate here!<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003274">"Jade: Draw Lunchtop."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You draw a really nice looking Squiddle lunchbox on the CAPTCHALOGUE SCRIBBLEPAD.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003275">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The modus recognizes what you were trying to draw and snaps it right up. Nice going!<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003276">"Jade: Captchalogue the beta."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Look at these fabulous beta envelopes you just drew!
<br />

<br />
Your sylladex thinks they are fabulous too!
<br />

<br />
YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003277">"Jade: Quick! Random scribbling!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You do a very quick doodle of nothing in particular.
<br />

<br />
The SCRIBBLEPAD appears to be processing the shapes.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003278">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Is that...
<br />

<br />
Is that Charles Dutton?<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003279">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Since you do not actually have a DUTTON PHOTO lying around, the pad captchalogues a DUTTON PHOTO GHOST IMAGE. It is not a tangible item, and can never be used ever. It seems to be more of an imprint on the card itself, like a watermark.
<br />

<br />
However, the back of the card does seem to contain a viable CAPTCHA CODE for a real DUTTON PHOTO, for whatever it's worth.
<br />

<br />
Which is very little.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003280">"Jade: Draw a pumpkin."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You sketch a beautiful, succulent PUMPKIN, knowing perfectly well that a PUMPKIN GHOST IMAGE will be captchalogued, because you are quite sure there is not a PUMPKIN in this room, and there surely never will be.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003281">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You captchalogue a PUMPKIN GHOST IMAGE.
<br />

<br />
At least you have the CAPTCHA CODE for it on the back in case you ever want to replicate a real one.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003282">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">oh nooooooo</span><br><br><br>
 <b> 02/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003283">"Jade: Get the rest of your items."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You start by drawing your TANGLE BUDDIES.
<br />

<br />
But... it looks like it's having trouble understanding the shapes?
<br />

<br />
Darn! You wanted those!<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003284">"Jade: Captchalogue bass on card with Dutton ghost image."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It's not up to you to say what card it goes on! The modus decides! All you get to do is draw.
<br />

<br />
Anyway you try sketching your ECLECTIC BASS. It's kind of hard to draw accurately.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003285">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
No, that's just a ghost image of an ordinary bass. That's not right.
<br />

<br />
You try again, focusing on getting all the mechanical details just right.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003286">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
ARGH!<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003287">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
OH NO BUSTED.

<br />
The jig is up.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003288">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are returned to your bedroom without the rest of your loot. You doubt you'll have time to go back and get it. You guess you have inadvertently left your own time capsule there for whatever party may find it in the future. Lucky bastards!<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003289">"Jade: Install Beta."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You get started installing both discs. Might as well get a jump on it to avoid the sort of future drama that results from poor time management decisions.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003290">"Jade: Pester chums."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
In the meantime you decide to touch base with your pals.

<br />
Ugh, no, not those pals. The TROLLSLUM can just sit tight for now.<br><br><br>

 <b> 02/16/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003304">"Jade: Organize Dave's puppets."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This whole place is a disorganized mess. It kind of reminds you of your room but full of weird and ironic stuff instead of cute and great stuff. Your stuff is so much better.
<br />

<br />
You're pretty sure these are all Dave's BRO'S puppets. You better not mess with them. Frankly his brother makes you a little nervous.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/16/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003305">"Jade: Tidy up Strider's apartment a little."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
What the apartment needs is a woman's touch. You grab a TOWEL you found lying around and dampen it with water from the toilet. This is how ordinary people clean ordinary houses, right?
<br />

<br />
Oops, you dropped it.<br><br><br>

<br />
Blech. Too warm. Need to find something to chill this down with.
<br />

<br />
Something to heat up your delicious GRAVY would be nice too.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003309">"AR: Retrieve mysterious artifacts from ruins."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You excuse yourself for a moment and retrieve a few of your personal belongings. These should really impress your visitors.
<br />

<br />
That musty old toy on the floor ought to make a nice peace offering for the feisty tall one too. You are quite certain that ladies like squishy useless things like that.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003310">"WV: Introduce new friends to John."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The yellow bandaged fellow seems to have slogged off somewhere. But the tall mail carrier with the lovely white complexion would probably get a kick out of your big computer with the weird boy on it.
<br />

<br />
You show her inside.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003311">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The hole blown into the the station by the caution guy's rocket leads into the third room, which had been locked.
<br />

<br />
Unsurprisingly there is another sort of gizmo in here and you have no idea what it does.
<br />

<br />
The station is very low on power so you don't think you'll be able to find out.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003312">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You unlock the third room from the inside, and go to the computer room.
<br />

<br />
There he is! The funny boy you were talking about. His name is John.
<br />

<br />
You encourage your alabaster friend so say hi to him using the human keypad communication system.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003313">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
But instead she takes note of your nice chalk drawings and pays you a compliment.
<br />

<br />
You are somewhat mystified by the fact that she is be more impressed by your silly drawings than your amazing technology.
<br />

<br />
Maybe simple things are the key to the heart of a lady. You do not know because you do not know anything about ladies really. They are a riddle draped in a mystery wrapped in post-apocalyptic shroudwear.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003314">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You decide to give her the chalk. She is grateful for the colorful present and thinks it looks like fun.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003315">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Suddenly a powerful aroma hits your nonexistent nostrils. Someone is cooking something delicious. It demands investigation.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003316">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You stop and examine the kind mayor's device. It is quite similar to the one in your station, before the unfortunate accident. The one with the familiar looking girl on it. Perhaps this one is best left alone.
<br />

<br />
Still, there is something familiar about the boy on this monitor too.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003317">"I am told your name is John. Is that correct?"</a></b><br><br>

<br />

 <b> 02/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003318">"It's nice to meet you, John."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
John isn't directly cognizant of your greeting, but I'm sure he would feel likewise.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003319">"Ok, John. Let's explore this place!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Ok, have at it! If you're at a loss, click the controller button up there.

This may or may not mean anything to you depending on your current perspective.<br><br><br>

 <b> 02/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003321">"There is nothing inside. Should we put something in?"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You drop in one of your precious SHOES. You hate to see it go, but you have to follow the custom and give it what the tablet asks for.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003322">"This one's empty. Perhaps a delivery is in order?"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are vaguely reminded of something. It's hard to remember. It was so many years ago.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/22/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003355">"So many years ago, entrenched in the temporally oblique..."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
What have we here? An illegally parked vehicle. 
<br />

<br />
You sure hope this guy's got a swollen porkhollow. He just landed himself in citation city.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/22/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003357">"AR?: Surround the scene with caution tape."</a></b><br><br>

Hello. What have we here?<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/22/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003359">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You discover a couple of UNAUTHORIZED PARCELS in the cabin of the vehicle. You confiscate them immediately.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/22/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003360">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are a simple PARCEL MISTRESS on one of your routes. Today is another day of uneventful but highly satisfying deliveries.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/22/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003361">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You stop in your tracks. It is a dangerous AGENT from the enemy kingdom. Perhaps you should avoid him.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/22/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003362">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
But you notice he is holding two parcels. You recognize one of them. You have spent a long time looking for it. 
<br />

<br />
It looks like you are going to need to get that package from him somehow.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/22/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003363">"John: Activate ghost gloves."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 02/23/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003372">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 02/23/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003373">"WV, PM, AR: Stargaze."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It is a clear and peaceful night. A delicious meal has been shared with new friends. The glow of the ammunition fire gradually subsides. All is well.
<br />

<br />
But you can't shake the feeling there is something familiar about all this. There is something you are forgetting.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/23/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003374">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Of course. Now you remember. 
<br />

<br />
You must deliver a message to John right away.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/23/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003375">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 02/23/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003376">"PM?: Retrieve package."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You conclude you have no choice. You will march right up to him and ask politely for the package.
<br />

<br />
Wait a minute...
<br />

<br />
What's this?<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/23/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003377">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It is a carved MINITABLET. 
<br />

<br />
The carving is not especially clear to say the least. But your wealth of delivery experience allows you to decipher it immediately. 
<br />

<br />
It is the other parcel the agent is holding. It appears you will need to acquire both from him now. It is your sworn duty.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003378">"PM?: Ready sword."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You do not have a sword. You are quite sure it would never occur to you to carry a sword or resort to violence under any circumstance.
<br />

<br />
You will have to take a more diplomatic route with this fellow.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003379">"AR?: Doff your hat to the attractive female."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You doff so furiously you are in danger of starting a HAT FIRE. 
<br />

<br />
Probably not the best idea around all this oil. Especially without any sort of <a href="http://images.google.com/images?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;tbs=isch%3A1&amp;sa=1&amp;q=barbasol&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g1&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;start=0&amp;social=false" target="_blank" class="postlink">flame suppressant</a> handy.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003380">"PM?: Retrieve both parcels."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
He cannot give them to you. They are ILLEGAL CONTRABAND, and if you wish to petition for their release, you must consult with his superiors.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003381">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You show him the carved MINITABLET. As he can plainly see, you have signed authorization to deliver one of the parcels.
<br />

<br />
He gives you the ENVELOPE. But he retains the PACKAGE.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003382">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You quickly drop the ENVELOPE into an empty PYXIS. It is out of your hands now. THE BREEZE will know where to take it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003383">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You follow the agent. You must not lose track of that parcel.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003384">"John: Chase the man, you want your book!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You have some questions for that guy, whoever he is.
<br />

<br />
But the village is still burning. You've got to help these salamanders put out this fire.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003385">"John: Save the lizards!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Ok you JUST SAID they were salamanders.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, thank goodness for your BARBASOL BOMB. The cooling lather should work its magic in no time...<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003386">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 02/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003387">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
A big gust of wind conveniently comes along and blows out all the fire. 
<br />

<br />
It is really convenient.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003388">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The townspeople rejoice and are more than willing to give you all the credit. You suspect it is probably because they are not all that smart.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003389">"John, the uncarved tablet you retrieved."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 02/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003390">"Great! I would like you to carve something on it."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You seem amenable to this request. It's a little wobbly up on top of all these dancing lizards though.
<br />

<br />
Not that it matters because you suck at drawing anyway.<br><br><br>

 <b> 02/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003393">"Is it not why you are here?"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Someone is pestering you. But you are oblivious to the message because your laptop is buried under three inches of fucking yarn.
<br />

<br />
There are footprints in the white sand.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003394">"Follow them."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 02/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003395">"Examine your pet's tomb."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The mausoleum was destroyed by the explosion. The secret passage remains. 
<br />

<br />
You build a bigger and better town to preside over. All expatriates are welcome, no matter what happened in the past, regardless of professional persuasion or metallurgical affiliation. You cut the town's ribbon with an official JUDICIAL BAYONET, which is stuck inside a grenade but you are kind of nervous about removing it.
<br />

<br />
This should catch the eye of the tall nice lady.
<br />

<br />
The grumpy yellow guy thinks this is dumb.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/26/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003401">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
He thinks it is dumb because any town without a proper militia is as good as conquered.
<br />

<br />
As such he prepares one begrudgingly. It's a dirty job, but someone must be charged with the defense of the innocent.<br><br><br>

 <b> 02/28/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003412">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You take the BETA and the CD.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/28/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003413">"Jade: Deploy circuit board looking thingy."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It was obviously labeled as the JUMPER BLOCK EXTENSION. 
<br />

<br />
It appears to be deployable only as an extension to the ALCHEMITER. Looks like you're going to have to move it.
<br />

<br />
Damn, and it looked so nice up there!<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/28/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003414">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You expend another relatively affordable 100 BUILD GRIST to relocate it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/28/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003415">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You then pay the steep fee of 1000 BUILD GRIST to deploy the JUMPER BLOCK EXTENSION.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/28/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003416">"Jade: Attempt to deploy catchalogue disk drive."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Again, the name of the thing was right there in plain sight. 
<br />

<br />
You deploy the PUNCH CARD SHUNT for peanuts.
<br />

<br />
Looks like a captchalogue card is supposed to fit in the slot.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/28/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003417">"Dave: Insert card with the CD on the slot."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You put the card in the slot and stick the shunt on the jumper pins.
<br />

<br />
Nothing happens. You might need to stick a punched card in there, probably allowing the holes in the card to affect the flow of current through the circuits. And to punch cards you'll need to get a designix somehow.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/28/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003418">"Dave: Insert disc into computer."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/28/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003419">"Dave: Install software."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/28/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003420">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
GRISTTORRENT is now running.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/01/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003421">"Dave: Illegally pirate some of John's shale."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You start leeching off John's SHALE at a pace of 4 g/s. 
<br />

<br />
Not the fastest download rate, but then again you don't need a whole lot. In one second you already collect enough for a PUNCH DESIGNIX.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/01/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003422">"Dave: Download a bunch of grist from John. He has plenty."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You set the application to leech off John's BUILD GRIST because he's obviously got too much for his own good.
<br />

<br />
It cuts the download rate in half though.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/02/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003423">"You guide the Heir. Consult with him."</a></b><br><br>

The package from your pen-pal appears again. You've been wondering when it was going to show up. It has been months since you last worked on it!

Hopefully your friend has made the final modifications you require. You'll have to mail it soon so it reaches John in time!<br><br><br>

You have followed the AUTHORITY REGULATOR into enemy territory. It is a risky move and this dark palace makes you very uncomfortable. But it is imperative you press on and recover that parcel.

<br />
You have brought along a PARKING CITATION. If confronted, you will say you are only here to deliver payment and leave.<br><br><br>

 <b> 03/04/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003441">"Rose: Sip martini thoughtfully."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You follow the command telling you to command John to put the carved tablet in the pyxis and type, &quot;John, put the carved tablet into the pyxis.&quot;
<br />

<br />
You successfully do that, and he successfully does that too. Everyone is friendly and cooperative.<br><br><br>

 <b> 03/05/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003448">"PM?: Locate the Archagent."</a></b><br><br>

You find the agent's office. But he is nowhere to be found.
<br />

<br />
You eye something on the desk there.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/05/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003449">"PM?: Grab the box and run!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
If you act quickly enough maybe you can grab the package and get out of here before <span style="font-style: italic">CAN I HELP YOU</span><br><br><br>

<br />
Mr. Noir tells you that ticket had better be notarized and punched in triplicate and presented with the full boondollar penalty plus processing fees, or you are wasting valuable time he could otherwise spend shirking his clerical duties.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/05/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003451">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Ticket? Oh, this thing. Ha, ha, look at that, you are holding a ticket. How did that get in your hand? It belongs on the desk with the others. No, you are not here to pay a parking ticket.
<br />

<br />
You explain to the frightening man that you are here to pick up that green parcel.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/05/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003452">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Jack makes it clear he would rather stab something to death than process the avalanche of paperwork needed to release the confiscated freight. Also any legit courier would have the pickup forms ready to go. In spite of how he's supposed to be dressed now but isn't, he ain't nobody's fool.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/05/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003453">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
But perhaps an UNDERSTANDING can be reached.
<br />

<br />
He gives you a HIT LIST.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/05/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003454">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Bring him the crowns. He'll give you the box.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/06/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003455">"Jack: Examine package."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The PARCEL MISTRESS departs with her mission of double agency. You wonder if she'll actually be so foolish as to attempt to uphold her end of the lopsided bargain. You make a policy of handing out a REGISWORD and a HITLIST to just about everyone who enters your office. But you never think anyone's actually going to GO THROUGH with it.
<br />

<br />
You wish you could watch. She's a deadwoman.
<br />

<br />
You wonder why she's so desperate to acquire this package. What could be inside?<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/06/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003456">"Jack: Open it."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/06/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003457">"Dave: Punch some cards."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You've leeched more than enough grist from John to afford a PUNCH DESIGNIX, which for some reason Jade put in the hallway making it kind of hard to walk through your apartment, but whatever. You also have plenty of grist for messing around with the ALCHEMITER to manufacture some new gear if you want. But you'd like to figure out what the JUMPER BLOCK does first.
<br />

<br />
Jade keeps dropping a weird assortment of objects for you to captchalogue and punch. You've given up trying to identify any rhyme or reason to the thought process behind it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/06/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003458">"Dave: Put a punched card in a shunt."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You put the punched BLENDER card in a shunt just for the hell of it, and stick it on the jumper pins.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/06/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003459">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The ALCHEMITER is fitted with the BLENDER UPGRADE.
<br />

<br />
This upgrade doesn't seem all that useful. Looks like all it does is grind up your totems.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/06/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003460">"Dave: Use a punched Gamebro Magazine card."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The ALCHEMITER is upgraded with a huge metal bust of this awesome bro.
<br />

<br />
The device has been reduced to an utterly useless heap of shit.
<br />

<br />
Time to yank out all the shunts and start over.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/06/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003461">"Jade: Draw the punch designix."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your inscrutable thought process leads you to draw the PUNCH DESIGNIX on your SCRIBBLEPAD.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/06/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003462">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The pad recognizes the drawing, but there is no designix around, and even if there was, it would obviously be way too big to captchalogue.
<br />

<br />
Instead, the GHOST IMAGE of the designix is captcha'd, along with its captcha code on the back.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/06/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003463">"Jade: Send the code to Dave."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: so i guess this is just a built in designix</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: which is sort of cool i guess</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: since i wont have to go downstairs and bang the hallway door into the thing and squeeze through every time i want to punch a card</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: because of course you couldnt have just put it next to the alchemiter in the first place</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: but then i have to go downstairs anyway to make totems and get cruxite and stuff</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: so really who cares</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: well i think this is only one way to consolidate all the gizmo features....</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: hang on ill give you more codes!!!</span><br><br><br>
 <b> 03/07/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003465">"Jade: Draw the holopad."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You don't have nearly enough grist to deploy the HOLOPAD, whatever it does. But maybe you can get it as a freebie upgrade to the alchemiter.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/07/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003466">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Looks like it worked! You love your scribblepad.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/07/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003467">"Dave: Upgrade alchemiter with holopad."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The totem pedestal is converted into a holographic projector. It projects an image of the item the punch code represents.
<br />

<br />
This seems useful for previewing an item a code will produce, without spending the grist on it. You test it out with the blender card.
<br />

<br />
But it still renders the alchemiter unusable. At least without further upgrades.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/07/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003468">"Jade: Draw the totem lathe."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You captcha the lathe ghost image and apply the upgrade.
<br />

<br />
Now the holopad projects a hologram of the totem that a punch card will create!
<br />

<br />
This appears to turn the alchemiter into a one stop-shopping hub. You just punch a card, stick it in, and get your item. Nice!<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/07/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003469">"Jade: Draw the jumper block."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You get the code for the jumper block extension to upgrade the alchemiter with... uh... the jumper block extension?
<br />

<br />
Ok that's kind of a crappy drawing but it seemed to work anyway.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/07/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003470">"Dave: Upgrade."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This is getting a little abstract.
<br />

<br />
But it appears to economize on space. Now all you have to do is stick a card in a slot to apply an upgrade. Don't have to bother with the shunts anymore.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/07/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003471">"Jade: Draw the intellibeam laserstation."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This thing looks kind of complicated.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/07/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003472">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
DAMMIT!<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/09/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003473">"Dave: Captchalogue enlarger."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You grab the ENLARGER from your dismantled photography lab.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/09/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003474">"Dave: Upgrade."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You apply the ENLARGER UPGRADE.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/09/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003475">"Jade: Draw air conditioner on roof."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You ghost-captcha the huge air conditioner and give Dave the code to mess around with.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/09/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003476">"Dave: Make air conditioner unit."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Size of the object you make is now variable. The bigger, the more expensive, as one would expect.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/09/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003477">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make a tiny AIR CONDITIONER.
<br />

<br />
This was totally not a waste of time!<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/10/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003478">"John: Find the car."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You find your father's car near the base of the rock pillar. It is surrounded by caution tape for some reason. You are reminded to be cautious.
<br />

<br />
You cautiously inspect the vehicle. To no one's surprise but yours, the package and the game are missing.
<br />

<br />
Someone is bugging you.<br><br><br>

<span style="color: #e00707">TG: it was such a huge mistake prototyping seppucrow with this useless mindnumbing jackass</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: im going back</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Already?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what do you mean already shit took 4 goddamn months</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: or something</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i dont know im kind of losing track of how long its been with all this time hopping</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It just sounds like you're making a rash decision based on temporary aggravation with a laughing puppet.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I thought we planned to progress as far as we could before you went back.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: To gather information, and avoid repeating mistakes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what else is there to know</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: we lost</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: cant finish the game with a dead heir and witch</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: We don't know Jade is dead for sure.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: yeah well she had a big fucking meteor bearing down on her and we never heard from her again</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: or the trolls for that matter</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: after they tricked john into skipping way ahead and getting his ass handed to him by the denizen</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i guess once they managed to sabotage us they were done with us</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and since john died he couldnt get jade in on time so whether shes alive or not shes as good as dead from our perspective </span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: only thing left to do is change all that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Are you sure you're ready?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You'll remember the plan we discussed?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: theres not much to remember</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i go back and tell john not to be an idiot and get trolled like such a gullible stooge</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i dont know what he was thinking</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: even we couldnt kill one of those things yet</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: with our higher levels and all our sick gear</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It still seems hasty to me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Maybe I'm just not as comfortable with time travel as you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: nah itll be fine dont worry</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: After you go, what do you think will happen to me?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Will I just cease to exist?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i dont know</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i mean your whole timeline will</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: maybe</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Maybe?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Is there a chance it'll continue to exist, and I'll just be here alone forever?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm not sure which outcome is more unsettling.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: the thing with time travel is</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: you cant overthink it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: just roll with it and see what happens</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and above all try not to do anything retarded</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What do you think I should do?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: try going to sleep</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: our dream selves kind of operate outside the normal time continuum i think</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: so if part of you from this timelines going to persist thats probably the way to make it happen</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and hey you might even be able to help your past dream self wake up sooner without all that fuss you went through</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I think the true purpose of this game is to see how many qualifiers we can get to precede the word &quot;self&quot; and still understand what we're talking about.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: the true purpose is to make a sprite that doesnt make me want to flog myself raw with my own brain stem</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: anything else is gravy</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: If my past self can wake up sooner, maybe I'll be the one to visit you first this time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'll fly by and remind you you're already awake and don't know it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: yeah thatd be cool i guess</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: im gonna go now</span>
<br />

<br />
You open the package. There is something suspicious inside.
<br />

<br />
Something suspiciously dirty and smelly.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/04/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003561">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It is a STUFFED BUNNY. Much like the one <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scraps/dontmoveorthebunnygetsit.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink">held hostage</a> briefly by Malkovich's Cyrus &quot;The Virus&quot; while taunting hard-luck protagonist Cameron Poe. And strikingly similar to the one scooped up from the soot of a burning Vegas strip by Cage's Poe and offered to his daughter, a gesture symbolic of a tattered exterior surrounding a heart of gold. Poe wasn't much to look at. But he was a good man.
<br />

<br />
But no, it is not merely LIKE that bunny. According to this NOTE OF AUTHENTICITY, it is the VERY SAME BUNNY.
<br />

<br />
This is so awesome.
<br />

<br />
Included is a note from your best bro Dave.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/04/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003562">"so hey"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">so hey
<br />

<br />
since its your bday i had to get you back for the sick memorabilia you got me so i got you this godawful thing and now i just know youre standing there flipping your shit over it so youre welcome. 
<br />

<br />
its the actual gross bunny in the movie so that means nick cage actually grubbed it up with his clownish no talent fingers. i would suggest you put it somewhere and display it ironically but i know youre dead serious about this ridiculous shit so youll probably sleep with the damn thing and nibble its ear and stuff.
<br />

<br />
but the weird thing is thats whats cool about you. youre this naive guy like pinocchio tumbled ass backwards off the turnip truck and started liking ghostbusters. then the fairy godmother kissed your nose or some shit and you turned out to be not made of wood and also pretty cool to talk to. one day your gooberish ways are gonna land you in a jam and i know im going to have to get you off the hook but its cool i got your back bro.
<br />

<br />
then we'll meet and hug bump and get each others filthy wife beaters that much filthier so yeah
<br />

<br />
peace dawg

Homestuck <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=001901" target="_blank" class="postlink">began</a> on April 13th, 2009, the 13th birthday of our chief protagonist and future <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002781" target="_blank" class="postlink">boy-skylark</a>, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=001903" target="_blank" class="postlink">John Egbert</a>. <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=001922" target="_blank" class="postlink">Three days prior</a> was supposed to be the day he received the Sburb <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=5" target="_blank" class="postlink">Beta</a> in the mail, but it was running late. It showed up <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=001986" target="_blank" class="postlink">later that afternoon</a>, and after overcoming <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=001990" target="_blank" class="postlink">a variety</a> of <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=001992" target="_blank" class="postlink">domestic adversities</a>, he <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002000" target="_blank" class="postlink">retrieved the game</a>, along with a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=001999" target="_blank" class="postlink">birthday package</a> from his internet friend, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002211" target="_blank" class="postlink">Dave Strider</a>.
<br />

<br />
John soon established a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002036" target="_blank" class="postlink">game connection</a> with another friend, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002116" target="_blank" class="postlink">Rose Lalonde</a>, who'd spent the day <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002035" target="_blank" class="postlink">badgering him</a> about playing with her, after unsuccessfully attempting to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=001935" target="_blank" class="postlink">convince Dave</a> to play. Upon <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002037" target="_blank" class="postlink">connecting</a>, Rose was able to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002039" target="_blank" class="postlink">manipulate John's environment</a>, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002063" target="_blank" class="postlink">move his furniture around via cursor</a>, and <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002048" target="_blank" class="postlink">restructure the shape of his room</a>. John was <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002053" target="_blank" class="postlink">unable</a> to do this to Rose's environment however. He'd installed the client copy of the beta, and required the server copy for that.
<br />

<br />
The <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=001985" target="_blank" class="postlink">server copy</a> was trapped in his dad's car, along with a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003456" target="_blank" class="postlink">birthday package</a> from another friend, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002668" target="_blank" class="postlink">Jade Harley</a>. Jade <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002069" target="_blank" class="postlink">messaged</a> John inquiring about the package. As of this moment, neither her package nor the server copy has been recovered by <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002408" target="_blank" class="postlink">John</a>. Rose had also prepared a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002989" target="_blank" class="postlink">package</a> for John, but had not mailed it yet. It still sits in her room. <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002032" target="_blank" class="postlink">Dave's package</a> contained the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002304" target="_blank" class="postlink">authentic stuffed bunny</a> <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003501" target="_blank" class="postlink">from Con Air</a>.
<br />

<br />
In addition to allowing Rose to control John's environment, Sburb provided an array of <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002051" target="_blank" class="postlink">devices</a> Rose <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002056" target="_blank" class="postlink">deployed</a> <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002057" target="_blank" class="postlink">throughout</a> John's house. <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002427" target="_blank" class="postlink">These devices</a> used together provided a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002517" target="_blank" class="postlink">system</a> by which the players could <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002525" target="_blank" class="postlink">manufacture any item</a> using <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002423" target="_blank" class="postlink">the code</a> on the back of that item's captchalogue card, if they gathered enough grist to pay for it. Later, they would learn to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002534" target="_blank" class="postlink">combine item codes</a> to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002952" target="_blank" class="postlink">master the art</a> of punch card alchemy, whereby items could be fused together in <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002956" target="_blank" class="postlink">purpose</a> and <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002955" target="_blank" class="postlink">design</a>.
<br />

<br />
One device on being <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002076" target="_blank" class="postlink">activated</a> began a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002078" target="_blank" class="postlink">countdown</a>, and <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002077" target="_blank" class="postlink">released</a> an entity called a kernelsprite. The countdown ticked down to the moment John's house would be <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002096" target="_blank" class="postlink">struck by a meteor</a>, destroying his neighborhood. To escape this demise, John had to use the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002081" target="_blank" class="postlink">devices</a> <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002105" target="_blank" class="postlink">to manufacture</a> a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002110" target="_blank" class="postlink">special item</a> that looked like a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002145" target="_blank" class="postlink">blue apple</a>, and <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002146" target="_blank" class="postlink">take a bite</a> of it, in order to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002150" target="_blank" class="postlink">transport</a> his entire house just before impact to the safety of a mysterious dark realm, where his house would situate itself atop a tall rock column high above a blanket of clouds. This realm is called the Medium.
<br />

<br />
Before he entered the Medium though, John and Rose <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002085" target="_blank" class="postlink">prototyped</a> his kernelsprite with the large harlequin doll his dad got him for his birthday, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002086" target="_blank" class="postlink">transforming</a> the sprite to bear its likeness, including the ways the doll was disfigured via earlier hijinks. It had a slashed eye and one arm, and so too did the sprite. When John entered the Medium, the sprite's kernel <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002151" target="_blank" class="postlink">hatched</a>, thus imbuing all the enemies John and his friends would face with properties of the sprite. The lesser adversaries John faced first, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002293" target="_blank" class="postlink">Shale Imps</a>, all wore harlequin garbs. They became more powerful and more radically mutated with each successive pre-Medium prototyping.
<br />

<br />
After <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002150" target="_blank" class="postlink">entering the Medium</a>, John's dad was <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002321" target="_blank" class="postlink">kidnapped by imps</a>. While John was looking for him, he accidentally <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002181" target="_blank" class="postlink">prototyped the sprite</a> with his grandmother's ashes, transforming it again. This prototyping had <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002287" target="_blank" class="postlink">no effect on the enemies</a>, since he was already in the Medium, and the kernel had already hatched. Instead, only the sprite was affected, and it took on the appearance, personality, and memories of his grandmother, becoming <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002184" target="_blank" class="postlink">Nannasprite</a>, a game-supplied albeit customized guide for John. She <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002320" target="_blank" class="postlink">explained aspects of the game</a>, about <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002322" target="_blank" class="postlink">Skaia</a> residing at the center of the Medium, beyond seven gates floating directly above his house, and about an <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002323" target="_blank" class="postlink">eternal/timeless war</a> fought there between dark and light, one that light was always <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002324" target="_blank" class="postlink">destined to lose</a>.
<br />

<br />
Rose, who'd been having frequent <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002073" target="_blank" class="postlink">internet connection issues</a>, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002190" target="_blank" class="postlink">lost her connection</a> as she tried to lift John's car to retrieve the game and the package. The car <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002191" target="_blank" class="postlink">fell into the abyss below</a>. <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002114" target="_blank" class="postlink">A storm</a> caused her house to lose power along with its wireless internet connection. Her laptop was able to run on battery power for a time, while she tapped into the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002139" target="_blank" class="postlink">wireless signal</a> from the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002886" target="_blank" class="postlink">laboratory next door</a>. When her laptop <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002195" target="_blank" class="postlink">ran out of power</a>, she had to overcome more <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002288" target="_blank" class="postlink">family strife</a> (and endure a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002290" target="_blank" class="postlink">gift pony</a> in the process), go <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002207" target="_blank" class="postlink">outside in the rain</a>, and plug it into the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002313" target="_blank" class="postlink">small generator</a> outside the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002312" target="_blank" class="postlink">mausoleum</a> of her dead cat, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002829" target="_blank" class="postlink">Jaspers</a>. She <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002315" target="_blank" class="postlink">continued her session</a> with John inside the mausoleum, while the meteor-sparked forest fire surrounding her house grew more intense.
<br />

<br />
From the house, Rose's mom <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002657" target="_blank" class="postlink">opened</a> a secret passage in the mausoleum to help her escape. <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002740" target="_blank" class="postlink">The passage</a> lead to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002747" target="_blank" class="postlink">the lab</a> next door,  where Rose <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002766" target="_blank" class="postlink">found</a> a stable, portable source of power and internet for her computer. She also found <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002774" target="_blank" class="postlink">a terminal</a> projecting the impact times and locations for the millions of meteors presently bombarding the planet, along with all the other live sessions of other players around the world. She also found a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002805" target="_blank" class="postlink">little girl's room,</a> <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002807" target="_blank" class="postlink">a mutant kitten</a> she named <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002902" target="_blank" class="postlink">Vodka Mutini,</a> and <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002833" target="_blank" class="postlink">a cloning machine</a> operating through the science of <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002834" target="_blank" class="postlink">ectobiology</a>. Its terminal was <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002829" target="_blank" class="postlink">locked</a> on to her cat Jaspers at <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002838" target="_blank" class="postlink">whatever point in his life</a> the user specified.
<br />

<br />
She attempted to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002831" target="_blank" class="postlink">appearify</a> Jaspers from a moment in her early childhood, before he <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002835" target="_blank" class="postlink">whispered a secret</a> to her. But doing so would have caused a paradox, so it <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002832" target="_blank" class="postlink">appearified (paradoxified)</a> a pile of slime instead. The machine used the slime to create a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002834" target="_blank" class="postlink">fetal paradox clone</a> of Jaspers in a glass tube. On the monitor, Jaspers then told young Rose the secret, then <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002836" target="_blank" class="postlink">vanished</a>, only to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002837" target="_blank" class="postlink">show up</a> dead weeks later and put in the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002838" target="_blank" class="postlink">mausoleum</a> for years until the present. Rose <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002841" target="_blank" class="postlink">left</a> the laboratory moments before it was destroyed by a meteor <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002887" target="_blank" class="postlink">impact.</a> She <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002885" target="_blank" class="postlink">transportalized</a> back to her mom's room, proceeded to her room to wait for Dave to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003048" target="_blank" class="postlink">connect</a> with her and rescue her from the next imminent impact.
<br />

<br />
Dave was <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002194" target="_blank" class="postlink">charged</a> with acquiring his bro's copy of the game to help Rose. Earlier he had lost his copy of the game to a mishap involving a crow. It flew in his window, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002253" target="_blank" class="postlink">seized the game</a>, and Dave accidentally <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002255" target="_blank" class="postlink">impaled it</a> with a sword, sending the crow and the game out the window onto a landing <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002344" target="_blank" class="postlink">far below</a> his apartment. He <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002510" target="_blank" class="postlink">searched his bro's room</a> unable to find it, was <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002363" target="_blank" class="postlink">briefly shadowed by Lil Cal</a>, and then <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002512" target="_blank" class="postlink">found a note</a> beckoning him to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002565" target="_blank" class="postlink">meet on the roof</a> for a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002736" target="_blank" class="postlink">confrontation</a>. Dave and his bro <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002771" target="_blank" class="postlink">dueled on the roof extensively</a>, and Dave was <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002970" target="_blank" class="postlink">thoroughly bested</a>. Upon defeating Dave, his bro dropped the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002971" target="_blank" class="postlink">copies of the game</a>, and flew off on his rocket board into the sky.
<br />

<br />
Dave used the copies to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003048" target="_blank" class="postlink">connect with Rose</a>, and <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003049" target="_blank" class="postlink">quickly deployed the devices</a> while her house was on fire, surrounded by flaming tornadoes, and minutes away from being destroyed by a meteor. Rose prototyped her kernelsprite with Jaspers, specifically to understand the meaning of the secret he whispered to her years ago. She was advised to do this by Jade, who <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002738" target="_blank" class="postlink">told her</a> about the game in the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002342" target="_blank" class="postlink">first place</a>. Dave then prototyped the kernelsprite again with the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002263" target="_blank" class="postlink">tentacled princess doll</a> given to Rose on her birthday by her mom. Both of these prototypings would have an <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003482" target="_blank" class="postlink">effect on the enemies</a> once Rose entered the Medium and the kernel hatched. Rose used the alchemiter to create the special item - for her, a purple wine bottle - which she needed to break to enter. She eventually did, transporting her house just before the meteor collided.
<br />

<br />
The <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002775" target="_blank" class="postlink">meteor</a> left a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003049" target="_blank" class="postlink">crater</a>. Over time, at the site of impact, a large, white structure that looked like a wine bottle grew there, and the crater filled up with sand as the climate of the post-apocalyptic Earth gradually changed. The <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002657" target="_blank" class="postlink">&quot;cork&quot;</a> of that bottle was a large metal <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002627" target="_blank" class="postlink">cylinder</a> with an interior much like an advanced science station, with a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002633" target="_blank" class="postlink">variety</a> of <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002569" target="_blank" class="postlink">devices</a> and <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002605" target="_blank" class="postlink">monitors</a> inside. 413 years after the meteor impact, the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002566" target="_blank" class="postlink">Wayward Vagabond</a> walked through the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002148" target="_blank" class="postlink">desert</a> and <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002171" target="_blank" class="postlink">discovered</a> this station. <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/waywardvagabond/anunsealedtunnel/" target="_blank" class="postlink">Inside</a>, he <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002608" target="_blank" class="postlink">found</a> canned <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002581" target="_blank" class="postlink">rations</a>, a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002594" target="_blank" class="postlink">firefly</a> he named <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002650" target="_blank" class="postlink">Serenity</a>, an <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002636" target="_blank" class="postlink">appearifier</a>, and <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002605" target="_blank" class="postlink">four monitors</a> hooked up to a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002339" target="_blank" class="postlink">keyboard</a>.
<br />

<br />
On one of the monitors was John, just after he'd entered the Medium. WV could <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002339" target="_blank" class="postlink">type commands</a> to John directly, much as the readers of this story could type commands for the characters to follow. Most of John's <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002153" target="_blank" class="postlink">actions</a> upon entering the Medium were <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002335" target="_blank" class="postlink">authored by WV</a>, until he became preoccupied with <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002610" target="_blank" class="postlink">other activities</a>, such as <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002585" target="_blank" class="postlink">building a town</a> out of cans, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002621" target="_blank" class="postlink">playing chess with cans</a>, and drawing chalk murals depicting the cosmological arrangement of Skaia, the Medium, the light and dark planets known as <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002602" target="_blank" class="postlink">Prospit</a> and <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002604" target="_blank" class="postlink">Derse</a>, and the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002603" target="_blank" class="postlink">four planets</a> the kids would each occupy upon entering the game, called <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003052" target="_blank" class="postlink">The Land of Wind and Shade (John)</a>, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003330" target="_blank" class="postlink">The Land of Light and Rain (Rose)</a>, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003545" target="_blank" class="postlink">the Land of Heat and Clockwork (Dave)</a>, and Jade's planet, which is yet to be seen.
<br />

<br />
He also activated a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002617" target="_blank" class="postlink">countdown</a> in the station which caused it to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002657" target="_blank" class="postlink">blast</a> out of the crater and fly to designated &quot;home&quot; coordinates. Along the way, it passed over the sand-filled crater that was the impact site for John's meteor, on the other side of the continent. John's meteor had caused a giant white tree to grow in the crater. The tree grew an <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/waywardvagabond/windsdownsideways/04.gif" target="_blank" class="postlink">apple-like station</a> from a branch, which fell to the sand. The Peregrine Mendicant found this station. After WV flew overhead, PM <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/waywardvagabond/windsdownsideways/03.gif" target="_blank" class="postlink">activated</a> her station's homing feature as well, which caused it to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/waywardvagabond/windsdownsideways/07.gif" target="_blank" class="postlink">fly</a> to the same destination. Along the way, she used her terminal to attempt to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002800" target="_blank" class="postlink">command Jade</a>, who from the perspective of the terminal, had just arrived in the Medium. This caused the terminal to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002802" target="_blank" class="postlink">explode</a> for unknown reasons, leaving a hole in the station. One of the station's robotic worms <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002824" target="_blank" class="postlink">recovered</a> one of PM's falling mailboxes, and she <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002825" target="_blank" class="postlink">befriended</a> it, after earlier <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/waywardvagabond/windsdownsideways/01.gif" target="_blank" class="postlink">slaying</a> another one with her black <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/waywardvagabond/asentrywakens/05.gif" target="_blank" class="postlink">regisword</a>.
<br />

<br />
WV <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002906" target="_blank" class="postlink">landed</a> at the site of the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002908" target="_blank" class="postlink">ancient frog ruins</a> across the now dried up Pacific Ocean. The site was once the island where Jade lived, but nothing of the island remained except for the ruins. The mountain her house was on, and the volcano next to it, were replaced by a large empty chasm. PM <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002935" target="_blank" class="postlink">landed</a> shortly after WV, and they <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002944" target="_blank" class="postlink">met</a>. They were confronted by the Aimless Renegade, who <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002940" target="_blank" class="postlink">fired</a> at <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002942" target="_blank" class="postlink">them</a> from the frog ruins with old weaponry he'd been hoarding, once belonging to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003003" target="_blank" class="postlink">Jade's grandpa</a>. Millions of years ago, the frog ruins <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002657" target="_blank" class="postlink">grew</a> from a crater, struck by a meteor that emerged from a Sburb portal in space. Jade's radioactive, omnipotent, space-warping dog named Becquerel <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002973" target="_blank" class="postlink">emerged</a> from this crater as well.
<br />

<br />
Jade's <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002815" target="_blank" class="postlink">grandpa</a> <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003031" target="_blank" class="postlink">pioneered</a> this <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002722" target="_blank" class="postlink">island</a>, and built the house Jade lives in. Her <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002819" target="_blank" class="postlink">grandpa</a> has been <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002820" target="_blank" class="postlink">dead</a> for many years, and stands stuffed in <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002815" target="_blank" class="postlink">front</a> of the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002811" target="_blank" class="postlink">fireplace</a>. She has been <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002882" target="_blank" class="postlink">looked after</a> by her <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003032" target="_blank" class="postlink">dog who she calls Bec</a>. She begins the day with several <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002691" target="_blank" class="postlink">tasks</a>  to accomplish - to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002880" target="_blank" class="postlink">feed Bec, and to retrieve</a> a birthday <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002898" target="_blank" class="postlink">package</a> <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002900" target="_blank" class="postlink">mailed</a> by John. She <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002718" target="_blank" class="postlink">irradiates</a> a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002716" target="_blank" class="postlink">steak</a>, and heads <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002842" target="_blank" class="postlink">outside</a> to the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002845" target="_blank" class="postlink">site</a> where the package will be <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002722" target="_blank" class="postlink">dropped</a>. She knows it will be dropped there because one of the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002677" target="_blank" class="postlink">reminders</a> she wears on her fingers jogs her memory about it. She wears them to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002975" target="_blank" class="postlink">keep track</a> of the many <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002743" target="_blank" class="postlink">things</a> she knows about the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002894" target="_blank" class="postlink">future</a>, through <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002973" target="_blank" class="postlink">dreams</a>.
<br />

<br />
She falls asleep frequently and <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002817" target="_blank" class="postlink">spontaneously</a>. When she sleeps, her <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002893" target="_blank" class="postlink">dream self</a> is awake, and living on the moon that orbits the light planet, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002926" target="_blank" class="postlink">Prospit</a>. Prospit very closely orbits Skaia, a huge sphere of blue sky and clouds, which nanna describes as a &quot;dormant crucible of unlimited creative potential.&quot; When Prospit's moon <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002951" target="_blank" class="postlink">eclipses</a> Skaia, it drifts into Skaia for a time, mingling with the clouds. Dream Jade then <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002973" target="_blank" class="postlink">witnesses</a> many past and future events in the clouds. While asleep, she is often confused about what is real and what isn't. When she wakes up, she <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002975" target="_blank" class="postlink">pieces together</a> future events from her memory of the cloud visions, and from logs recorded by her dreambot. Her <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002894" target="_blank" class="postlink">dreambot</a> is a robotic surrogate that activates while she sleeps in her bed. It mimics in the real world the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003349" target="_blank" class="postlink">movement and actions</a> of her dream self on the moon, and records a video log of what she sees while dreaming.
<br />

<br />
Prospit's <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002951" target="_blank" class="postlink">moon</a> has two <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002947" target="_blank" class="postlink">towers</a> of identical design, and similar design to Jade's house. <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002893" target="_blank" class="postlink">Dream Jade</a> lives in one tower. <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002949" target="_blank" class="postlink">Dream John</a> lives in the other. Dream John is still asleep, and John has no knowledge of the dream world, which is to say, the <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v296/Tenebrais/MSPA/Incipisphere-5.png" target="_blank" class="postlink">entire game session</a> he would initiate on his 13th birthday. When he goes to sleep, instead of waking up on the moon as Jade does, he remains slumbering in his dream room, tormented by his subconscious. This torment is expressed when he sleepwalks, and draws troubling <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002904" target="_blank" class="postlink">scribbles</a> on the walls of his room. When <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=001904" target="_blank" class="postlink">awake</a>, he cannot see the scribbles, as is subconscious suppresses his awareness of them. It is not until he has a perception-altering <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002848" target="_blank" class="postlink">revelation</a> about his dad does he begin to see them. He initially believed they were new additions to his room, perhaps <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002903" target="_blank" class="postlink">scrawled</a> by imps. However they were present long before, visible in his room while he prepared Jade's birthday package <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002899" target="_blank" class="postlink">months ago</a>.
<br />

<br />
John prepared a package for each of his three friends, whose 13th <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002899" target="_blank" class="postlink">birthdays</a> were December 1st (Jade), 3rd (Dave), and 4th (Rose). He gave <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002990" target="_blank" class="postlink">Rose</a> a knitting set, and she then took an intense interest knitting. He gave <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002996" target="_blank" class="postlink">Dave</a> the pair of shades Ben Stiller wore in Starsky and Hutch, which <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002998" target="_blank" class="postlink">he wore</a> from then on, replacing the shades in the style his bro wore. He gave <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003034" target="_blank" class="postlink">Jade</a> a blue version of his own ghost shirt, and some pumpkin seeds to help her replace the pumpkins that kept disappearing from her garden. But she did not receive this on the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003032" target="_blank" class="postlink">birthday</a> John intended. She received it in the past, on her birthday when she was very young, causing her to take an interest in <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003036" target="_blank" class="postlink">gardening</a> in the first place, to take a liking to blue apparel, and to eventually befriend John over the internet and lead him, Rose, and Dave down a path where they would ultimately play this game together.
<br />

<br />
Jade did <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002880" target="_blank" class="postlink">retrieve</a> his package in the present as planned, but immediately <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003012" target="_blank" class="postlink">took it</a> to another location where it <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003013" target="_blank" class="postlink">disappeared</a>. WV in the far future <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002912" target="_blank" class="postlink">appearified</a> it from that location on accident. The package contained further <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002914" target="_blank" class="postlink">instructions</a> for him. He was to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002939" target="_blank" class="postlink">bring it</a> to PM, and she was to use her station's <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003028" target="_blank" class="postlink">sendificator</a> to send it to another place and time. After she did this, the package <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003033" target="_blank" class="postlink">appeared</a> in front of young Jade on her birthday. Jade orchestrated the sequence of events through knowledge of them by her cloud visions.
<br />

<br />
She orchestrated similar events for the package she sent to John, plotting the circuitous route through time and space it was meant to follow. She again utilized the exiles for help, while they were still in the Medium. The exiles, WV, PM, and AR, were all formerly agents of the kingdoms, before they were exiled by some means to post-apocalyptic Earth. AR, as an <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003356" target="_blank" class="postlink">Authority Regulator</a> in the Land of Wind and Shade, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003359" target="_blank" class="postlink">discovered</a> the package and the beta copy in John's wrecked car as he gave it a parking ticket. PM, working as a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003360" target="_blank" class="postlink">Parcel Mistress</a>, recognized the package from a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002933" target="_blank" class="postlink">correspondence</a> she had with Jade on Prospit some time ago, and recalled it must be delivered to John. AR would not relinquish <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003380" target="_blank" class="postlink">the package</a>, though he did give her <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003381" target="_blank" class="postlink">the beta</a>, which she delivered into a pyxis to satisfy the carved request of a minitablet. John <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003390" target="_blank" class="postlink">carved</a> this tablet at the request of PM through the command terminal in the future.
<br />

<br />
AR brought the package to Derse, where it ultimately wound up on the desk of <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002855" target="_blank" class="postlink">Jack Noir</a>. Jack is the archagent of the dark kingdom, charged with overseeing affairs through his office's <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002855" target="_blank" class="postlink">fenestrated wall portals</a>, and <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003450" target="_blank" class="postlink">processing paperwork</a>. He is forced to wear a silly <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002856" target="_blank" class="postlink">garment</a> in keeping with prototyping themes by the Black Queen, an order he <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002859" target="_blank" class="postlink">resentfully</a> complies with. He oversaw the imprisonment of John's dad, who broke loose on <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002850" target="_blank" class="postlink">multiple</a> occasions. When Jack went to handle it personally, John's dad <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003040" target="_blank" class="postlink">set</a> Jack's hat on <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003041" target="_blank" class="postlink">fire</a>. In a surly act of gratitude, he <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003044" target="_blank" class="postlink">released</a> the prisoner. John's dad fled to the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003258" target="_blank" class="postlink">Land of Wind and Shade</a>, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003568" target="_blank" class="postlink">fought</a> large monsters, got his hat dirty and lost a shoe. He then carved tablet requests for new ones, which John <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003321" target="_blank" class="postlink">filled</a> via <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003322" target="_blank" class="postlink">pyxis</a>, unaware of who requested them.
<br />

<br />
PM <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003383" target="_blank" class="postlink">followed</a> AR to Derse in hopes of retrieving the package. After <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003432" target="_blank" class="postlink">wandering around</a>, she encountered the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003435" target="_blank" class="postlink">Black Queen</a> on her throne. Both the light and dark kingdoms each have a king and a queen. The queens sit on a throne, on Prospit and Derse respectively, ruling the planet. The kings command armies on the Battlefield, located at the center of Skaia. The queen takes on the attributes supplied by the prototypings due to the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002858" target="_blank" class="postlink">four-orbed ring</a> she wears. When the ring is removed, the queen is restored to normal. PM <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003436" target="_blank" class="postlink">showed</a> the BQ a parking ticket she was pretending to deliver. The BQ <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003437" target="_blank" class="postlink">directed</a> her to Jack's office, where the ticket should be filed.
<br />

<br />
PM <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003449" target="_blank" class="postlink">met</a> Jack and <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003451" target="_blank" class="postlink">asked</a> for the package. Jack proposed a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003453" target="_blank" class="postlink">deal</a>, and gave her a black <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003454" target="_blank" class="postlink">regisword</a>. If she would kill the White Queen and White King and bring him their crowns, he would give her the package. She accepted with little alternative. She then <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003512" target="_blank" class="postlink">visited</a> the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003513" target="_blank" class="postlink">WQ</a> on Prospit and <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003514" target="_blank" class="postlink">explained</a> the situation, with no intention of carrying out Jack's mission. The WQ, understanding the futility of their situation and the need to recover the package, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003518" target="_blank" class="postlink">abdicated</a>, and gave PM her crown and her ring. PM was <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003519" target="_blank" class="postlink">instructed</a> to go find the White King, retrieve his crown, and receive further instruction on what to do with the ring to protect it. WQ would then eventually <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003443" target="_blank" class="postlink">exile</a> herself to post-apocalypse Earth.
<br />

<br />
On post-apocalypse Earth, after AR <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003025" target="_blank" class="postlink">fired</a> on WV and PM from the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003259" target="_blank" class="postlink">ruins</a>, he spotted WV's <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003262" target="_blank" class="postlink">pumpkin</a>, which WV had earlier <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002638" target="_blank" class="postlink">appearified</a> from Jade's <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002664" target="_blank" class="postlink">house</a>. He recognized the carving of Bec's <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002843" target="_blank" class="postlink">silhouette</a> on the pumpkin. Fearful of it, he <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003263" target="_blank" class="postlink">surrendered</a>. The three exiles soon became <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003296" target="_blank" class="postlink">friends</a> over a campfire and shared <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003308" target="_blank" class="postlink">rations</a>. WV and AR built <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003400" target="_blank" class="postlink">Exile Town</a> out of cans, mailboxes, and bullets. PM operated WV's station <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003316" target="_blank" class="postlink">terminal</a> to submit <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003319" target="_blank" class="postlink">commands</a> to John as he <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003258" target="_blank" class="postlink">explored</a> the Land of Wind and Shade. In the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003402" target="_blank" class="postlink">sky</a>, another station teleported and <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003403" target="_blank" class="postlink">fell</a> to the ground. It was shaped like an egg, and originated from Dave's meteor impact site, in correspondence with the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003404" target="_blank" class="postlink">egg-shaped item</a> he would use to enter the medium. Emerging from this <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003444" target="_blank" class="postlink">station</a> was the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003443" target="_blank" class="postlink">Windswept Questant</a>, formerly the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003513" target="_blank" class="postlink">White Queen</a>.
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003445" target="_blank" class="postlink">AR and WV</a> sought to impress WQ by <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003508" target="_blank" class="postlink">crafting</a> a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003509" target="_blank" class="postlink">crown</a> for her out of a mailbox. She refused the distinction, instead <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003521" target="_blank" class="postlink">giving</a> it to PM, who had successfully completed her <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003362" target="_blank" class="postlink">mission</a> to deliver Jade's <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=001985" target="_blank" class="postlink">package</a> to John in the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003359" target="_blank" class="postlink">distant</a> past. The <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003380" target="_blank" class="postlink">means</a> by which she went about this have yet to be <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003456" target="_blank" class="postlink">seen</a>.
<br />

<br />
John entered the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003258" target="_blank" class="postlink">Land of Wind and Shade</a> (LOWAS) by having Rose <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002922" target="_blank" class="postlink">build</a> up his <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002981" target="_blank" class="postlink">house</a> to the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002325" target="_blank" class="postlink">first gate</a>, fighting through many imps and ogres with his powerful new <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002969" target="_blank" class="postlink">alchemized weapons</a>, and <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003049" target="_blank" class="postlink">entering</a> the gate. This took him to a location beneath the clouds, far <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003329" target="_blank" class="postlink">below</a> his <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003050" target="_blank" class="postlink">house</a>. The LOWAS turned out to be a large <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003387" target="_blank" class="postlink">windy</a> <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003052" target="_blank" class="postlink">planet</a>, full of dark terrain, incandescent <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003295" target="_blank" class="postlink">trees</a>, networks of <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003320" target="_blank" class="postlink">pipes</a>, and oily <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003498" target="_blank" class="postlink">rivers</a>. In addition to hosting more <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003363" target="_blank" class="postlink">powerful</a> <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003335" target="_blank" class="postlink">adversaries</a>, the land is occupied by <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003328" target="_blank" class="postlink">friendly</a> <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003323" target="_blank" class="postlink">consorts</a>, a race of <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003388" target="_blank" class="postlink">salamanders</a>. They help John understand the mythos of the land, and inform him of the planet's persecution by a sleeping denizen, which is responsible for <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003497" target="_blank" class="postlink">clogging the pipes</a> with oil, and trapping fireflies under the clouds.
<br />

<br />
Each planet has a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003505" target="_blank" class="postlink">sleeping denizen</a>, which the players must first wake, and then kill, in the course of their journey through the seven gates. Rose's planet, the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003307" target="_blank" class="postlink">Land of Light and Rain</a> (LOLAR) is a multicolored ocean planet with white sandy islands and pink ruins, and has a denizen responsible for <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003526" target="_blank" class="postlink">killing all life</a> in the water. Dave's planet, the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003541" target="_blank" class="postlink">Land of Heat and Clockwork</a> (LOHAC) is a lava planet, covered in industrial steel frame structures and turning gears, and has a denizen of yet unknown qualities.
<br />

<br />
Killing the denizen releases a huge grist hoard buried at the core of the planet, which is then used to fuel a process known as <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003505" target="_blank" class="postlink">The Ultimate Alchemy</a>. Along the way, the kids are meant to learn about their destined roles in this <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002659" target="_blank" class="postlink">quest</a> as the Heir of Breath (John), Seer of Light (Rose), Knight of Time (Dave), and Witch of space (Jade). Over the course of their quest, the dark kingdom will <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002324" target="_blank" class="postlink">inevitably defeat</a> the light kingdom. The Black Queen and King will take control, and initiate <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003567" target="_blank" class="postlink">The Reckoning</a>. This affects a belt of meteors, called The Veil, which orbits far from Skaia, between the four planets and Derse, and is host to various lab facilities used by the kingdoms. The Reckoning causes the meteors to descend on Skaia, ultimately destroying it, unless the Black Queen and King can be defeated in time. Skaia however buys time by opening defense portals to catch many of the meteors, redirecting them <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002774" target="_blank" class="postlink">elsewhere</a> in space and time.
<br />

<br />
This is the generic template for the way the game is supposed to proceed. It can deviate from this model however, depending on the actions of the players, and the details of the game mythology presented is unique to each group of players and their session.
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002990" target="_blank" class="postlink">Long before</a> John and his friends started playing the game, another group of players had been <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002993" target="_blank" class="postlink">persistently</a> <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002999" target="_blank" class="postlink">trolling</a> <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003428" target="_blank" class="postlink">them</a>, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002759" target="_blank" class="postlink">particularly Jade</a>. They are furious about an action she will take that will cause major problems in the four kids' game session, and inevitably lead to their defeat. Specifically, Jade will send <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=001985" target="_blank" class="postlink">a package</a> to John, apparently containing a powerful weapon he will need later. But the package winds up in <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003456" target="_blank" class="postlink">the hands of Jack Noir</a>, leading to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003568" target="_blank" class="postlink">dire consequences</a>. They <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003567" target="_blank" class="postlink">allude to</a> other things she will do that will lead to not only trouble for the four kids, but the troll players as well. 
<br />

<br />
The trolls consist of 12 kids from <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003136" target="_blank" class="postlink">an alien planet</a>, who went through <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003255" target="_blank" class="postlink">the same process</a> as John and his friends, escaping from the annihilation of their planet via meteors, and into the Medium to play the game. Their game session is entirely separate from that of the four kids. It has the same basic template, with its own Skaia, Prospit, Derse, Veil, and a planet for each troll, but separate game instances of these. They also have different instances of the same character templates, such as the kings and queens, and agents like Jack Noir. 
<br />

<br />
The trolls have completed their game session with yet unknown results. They now reside on a meteor in their Veil, sitting at terminals trolling John and co. From their terminals they can choose any point in the past or future of the kids to troll, and observe what they're doing at that moment. As a group, their only stated objective is to harass the kids, which they do so haphazardly throughout different points in the kids' timeline. Though they can choose any point on the kids' timeline to talk, they are mostly resigned to the understanding that no matter what they do, they can't change the outcome of the kids' actions. 
<br />

<br />
The four most vociferous trolls so far have been <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003426" target="_blank" class="postlink">carcinoGeneticist</a>, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003430" target="_blank" class="postlink">gallowsCalibrator</a>, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003493" target="_blank" class="postlink">grimAuxiliatrix</a>, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003496" target="_blank" class="postlink">and adiosToreador</a>. (The other 8 being apocalypseArisen, twinArmageddons, arsenicCatnip, arachnidsGrip, centaursTesticle, terminallyCapricious, caligulasAquarium, and cuttlefishCuller, each yet to be heard from.) 
<br />

<br />
carcinoGeneticist (CG) appears to have spearheaded the group's trolling campaign. While he was in the thick of his game session, the exile commanding him from a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003253" target="_blank" class="postlink">terminal</a> in the apocalyptic future was <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003055" target="_blank" class="postlink">Spades Slick</a>. This is one difference between his game session and John's, who had WV as an exile commanding him. In CG's session, his version of Jack Noir became <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003174" target="_blank" class="postlink">exiled</a> along the way, and took on the name Spades Slick. Three <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002857" target="_blank" class="postlink">other</a> <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003432" target="_blank" class="postlink">agents</a> were exiled, and the four of them formed a gang called the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002733" target="_blank" class="postlink">Midnight Crew</a>, and spent years building up a dark city in the future wasteland of the trolls' dead planet. Another difference in the trolls' session is that at some point along the way, the Black Queen was also exiled, later joined a rival gang called <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003070" target="_blank" class="postlink">The Felt</a>, assumed special powers that make her highly inadvisable to kill, and came to be known as <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003167" target="_blank" class="postlink">Snowman</a>. It was not until Slick confronted The Felt in their mansion that he discovered the station terminal to command CG, and not before Snowman <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003169" target="_blank" class="postlink">blinded him in one eye</a>, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003245" target="_blank" class="postlink">severed his arm</a>, and <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003247" target="_blank" class="postlink">locked him in a vault</a>. 
<br />

<br />
Each troll has a different trolling strategy, and a different rhythm by which they hop around the kids' timelines to chat with them. CG's strategy, for the most part, was to begin trolling them at the very end of their adventure, the moment at which he was most angry with their actions, and then gradually work backwards, mostly talking to John. This proves to be <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003503" target="_blank" class="postlink">mutually frustrating</a> though, as John knows less and less about the situation the further into the past CG goes. Similarly, the further into the future John progresses, the more he has the advantage over CG by knowledge of his future conversations with him, and vice versa. Over the course of the opposing directions of the two sides of the conversation, John learns more about the nature of the game and why they're being trolled, and in spite of hostility, they gradually befriend each other through an inevitability alluded to on both sides of the conversation. 
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003294" target="_blank" class="postlink">Early in the correspondence between John and CG</a>, which is to say late for CG, CG discovers he needs to get in touch with Jade, who refuses to talk to him in that time period. So he delivers a message to her much earlier, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003425" target="_blank" class="postlink">months in her past</a>, telling her she needs to contact him when she's in trouble. She will know to do this when her dreambot explodes in the future, an outcome that has not yet happened. 
<br />

<br />
Two other trolls, grimAuxiliatrix and adiosToreador (GA and AT) have targeted only Rose and Dave thus far. GA has hopped <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003492" target="_blank" class="postlink">arbitrarily back and forward</a> in Rose's timeline to talk to her, and is attempting to cultivate a friendship with her that now seems rigged through a series of conversational time loops, while seeking <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003489" target="_blank" class="postlink">counsel from Dave</a> on how to befriend her. AT sought <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003490" target="_blank" class="postlink">counsel from Rose</a> on how to troll Dave more effectively, after getting <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002999" target="_blank" class="postlink">severely counter-trolled</a> by him. He is under the impression he <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003495" target="_blank" class="postlink">rebounded nicely</a> though. 
<br />

<br />
gallowsCalibrator (GC) has stayed mostly linear in her trolling patterns, and has done so under the guise of helping the kids on their quest. She convinces John to take <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003480" target="_blank" class="postlink">a shortcut</a> through his land, shows him the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003505" target="_blank" class="postlink">denizen's palace</a>, leads him to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003507" target="_blank" class="postlink">warp back</a> to his house, then shows him how to fix the faulty rocket pack he made earlier through an <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002525" target="_blank" class="postlink">alchemy mishap</a>. She tells him to use the rocket pack to fly up to the seventh gate, enter the denizen's palace, and kill it in its sleep. He complied with this, and <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003540" target="_blank" class="postlink">flew</a> through the seventh gate, in spite of reservations from Dave, who'd just <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003545" target="_blank" class="postlink">entered the Medium</a> the moment before John took off. 
<br />

<br />
GC also <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003424" target="_blank" class="postlink">assisted Rose</a>, just after <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003485" target="_blank" class="postlink">she bested an ogre with ease</a>. She counseled her on understanding her role as the Seer of Light, and the meaning of the voice in her head as an exile issuing commands from a terminal. In her case, it was the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003443" target="_blank" class="postlink">exiled White Queen</a> issuing commands from the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003403" target="_blank" class="postlink">egg shaped station</a> in the future. Since Dave is Rose's server player, the terminal station from Dave's impact site issues commands to Rose. Just as the station at Rose's site, which WV found, issues commands to John, her client player.
<br />

<br />
After <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003492" target="_blank" class="postlink">conversing with GA</a>, Rose found Jaspersprite and <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003526" target="_blank" class="postlink">interrogated him</a> about the secret which she found so maddeningly mysterious years ago. He explained elements of the mythos of her land, and how she'd need to learn to play the rain to produce the musical analogue of a genetic code to reintroduce life into the ocean. In response to her question about his secret, he simply replied &quot;Meow.&quot; She mistook this for more nonsense, but it was in fact the secret he told her years ago. The four letter sequence MEOW unlocked a genetic code in her subconscious, which she would spend years <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003527" target="_blank" class="postlink">scrawling</a> on her wall using those letters in place of the typically used GCAT letters, while completely oblivious to the scrawlings and their meaning just as John was. As Jaspers said, she would understand their meaning when her dream self wakes up.
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003568" target="_blank" class="postlink">Rose's dream self</a> lives in a tower on the moon of Derse. Dave's dream self lives on the same moon in the other tower. It was suggested by Rose's future self, who is fully awake in the tower, that Dave had already been awake in his tower all along without realizing it. This was suggested in a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003543" target="_blank" class="postlink">conversation</a> she had in the future with Dave. It was an alternative future timeline not meant to be.
<br />

<br />
This future timeline came about by this series of events.
<br />

<br />
Dave was able to enter the Medium by <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003293" target="_blank" class="postlink">connecting with Jade</a> as his server player. Jade <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003266" target="_blank" class="postlink">got copies of the game</a> from the frog ruins, after she <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003012" target="_blank" class="postlink">delivered John's package</a> to her past self. She snuck into the ruins while Bec was asleep, and retrieved the game from a lotus time capsule which had been ticking down for millions of years. The game was Dave's copy from the future, the same one that <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002255" target="_blank" class="postlink">fell out the window</a> with the impaled crow. Once she got the game, the time capsule started ticking down again, set to expire 413 years later, when the exiles are there. She dropped some items in the ruins, leaving them there for <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003309" target="_blank" class="postlink">AR to find</a>, and leaving her <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003011" target="_blank" class="postlink">bass jammed in the elevator</a>. Bec then <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003287" target="_blank" class="postlink">found her there</a>, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003288" target="_blank" class="postlink">took her back to her room</a>, and grounded her there for the rest of the evening.
<br />

<br />
She quickly helped Dave <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003289" target="_blank" class="postlink">set up the game</a>, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003415" target="_blank" class="postlink">upgrading</a> his <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003298" target="_blank" class="postlink">alchemiter</a> <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003474" target="_blank" class="postlink">heavily</a>, and crafting the special item he needed to enter the Medium, a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003404" target="_blank" class="postlink">red egg</a>, which needed to be incubated and hatched to activate. She <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003346" target="_blank" class="postlink">prototyped his kernelsprite</a> with the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003345" target="_blank" class="postlink">impaled crow</a>, which would affect the enemies later, including the Black Queen. The sprite <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003407" target="_blank" class="postlink">built a nest</a> on top of his apartment's antenna tower, and <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003406" target="_blank" class="postlink">stole the egg</a> to incubate it for hours. A very large meteor was soon <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003531" target="_blank" class="postlink">bearing down</a> on his city.
<br />

<br />
Dave then entered the Medium through a series of unseen events. Jade was <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003527" target="_blank" class="postlink">asleep</a>, thus <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003347" target="_blank" class="postlink">forbidden by Dave</a> from <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003306" target="_blank" class="postlink">interacting</a> with his <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003337" target="_blank" class="postlink">environment</a> at all. Jade <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003529" target="_blank" class="postlink">complied</a> for fear of <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003349" target="_blank" class="postlink">retribution</a>. Dave was faced with the Crowsprite, which appeared to be suggesting he prototype it again with the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002982" target="_blank" class="postlink">remains of Lil Cal</a>. Dave <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003537" target="_blank" class="postlink">consulted with John</a> on this, who was about to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003539" target="_blank" class="postlink">rocket up</a> to the seventh gate. John had no advice, and proceeded up through the gate against better judgment.
<br />

<br />
Dave prototyped the sprite <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003542" target="_blank" class="postlink">with Cal</a>. John entered the palace, presumably found the denizen, and was easily killed by it, as was the intent of GC's trick on him. This meant John could not establish a connection with Jade to rescue her from the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002776" target="_blank" class="postlink">looming meteor</a>, and <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003543" target="_blank" class="postlink">Dave and Rose</a> lost contact with her, presuming her dead. Dave and Rose then spent the next four months in the Medium, advancing <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003541" target="_blank" class="postlink">as far as they could</a> to collect information before Dave decided to travel back in time to change events.
<br />

<br />
Dave used his time tables to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003544" target="_blank" class="postlink">go back</a> to the moment he was about to prototype with Cal. Both <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003549" target="_blank" class="postlink">he and his past self</a> strongly urged John not to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003552" target="_blank" class="postlink">go through the gate</a>. John was reluctant at first, but soon <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003563" target="_blank" class="postlink">reconsidered</a>, and <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003564" target="_blank" class="postlink">flew down</a> beneath the clouds. Future Dave then gave Present Dave all his <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003550" target="_blank" class="postlink">advanced gear</a>, and prototyped the Crowsprite <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003551" target="_blank" class="postlink">with himself</a> to make Davesprite, thus serving as his own guide from the future. 
<br />

<br />
Before going back in time, Future Dave <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003543" target="_blank" class="postlink">convinced Future Rose</a> to go to sleep. He suggested her dream self would be unaltered by the timeline shift, and in her dream state she would remember the events from the future. <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003544" target="_blank" class="postlink">When Dave went back</a>, Rose's future dream self <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003555" target="_blank" class="postlink">assumed the position</a> of Rose's present dream self. <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003556" target="_blank" class="postlink">Rose fell asleep</a>, and on <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003568" target="_blank" class="postlink">Derse's moon</a>, she instantly woke up. She then saw all the genetic scrawlings she did in MEOW letters, and understood their meaning.
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile on <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003568" target="_blank" class="postlink">Derse below</a>, the Black Queen <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002858" target="_blank" class="postlink">again</a> insisted that Jack Noir abide by the dress code. He refused, and the queen threatened him. He picked up <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002897" target="_blank" class="postlink">Jade's package to John</a>, removed what was <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003455" target="_blank" class="postlink">inside</a>, and used it to slice her ring finger off. He then killed the Black Queen, put on the ring, and donned the full upgrade supplied by <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002085" target="_blank" class="postlink">the</a> <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003049" target="_blank" class="postlink">three</a> <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003346" target="_blank" class="postlink">prototypings</a>.
<br />

<br />
He then became Jackspers Noirlecrow, which is a name I just made up now.
<br />

<br />
And then after that <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003570" target="_blank" class="postlink">you started watching me</a> <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003574" target="_blank" class="postlink">type</a> in this <a href="http://www.blackfives.com/blog_pics/carnegie_study.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink">ridiculous study</a> I <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/family/?promoid=BPDEK" target="_blank" class="postlink">photoshopped</a> for myself with my <a href="http://andrewhussie.blogspot.com/2009/01/need-for-steed.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">cool horse painting</a> propped up in the background.<br><br><br>

I <span style="font-style: italic">CONJURE</span> THIS INTREPID FANTASYSCAPE WITH TEARS BLED FROM THE WISDOM-WEARY EYES OF FIFTY THOUSAND IMAGINARY MAGICIANS.

<br />
Alright. It won't be that exciting to watch though.
<br />

<br />
I'll pull up Photoshop again. Here's the file I was using for the fourth wall.

<br />
What do you want me to draw?<br><br><br>

<br />
Sure. 
<br />

<br />
How about if I drag the content from one of the John files under the fourth wall layer, so we can make a more graceful transition out of this ludicrous, highly disruptive self-insertion arc?<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/15/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003581">"AH: That sounds like a good idea."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Oh! And then you can type something like &quot;Switch wall's view to show us what's going on with John.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Here, I'll prepare the GIF file for that. It'll just take a few seconds.
<br />

<br />
You decide that's entirely enough of that. If this website becomes any more self-aware in a playfully self-deprecating yet weirdly self-aggrandizing manner, you're going to go drown a bag of puppies in a sewer.<br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: what</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: she tricked me again.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: who</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: GC.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: she told me how to get to the 2nd gate.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: so i went through, but it took me to rose's house instead.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: another prank!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: dude you did go through the second gate</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: i mean i dont know why you would listen to her again</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: kind of moronic but thats a whole other issue</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: she didnt trick you this time</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh...</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: this is how it works</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: the progression of gates is like this whole round robin thing</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: cycling through each planet</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: gate 2 on your planet leads to gate 2 on roses</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: then you build up to gate 3 above her house which leads somewhere else on her planet</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: you look for gate 4 somewhere there</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: which leads to gate 4 above my house</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: and so on</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: wow, ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: ordinarily rose would have already gone through her gate 1</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: but shes sleeping pretty hard obviously</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: and ordinarily you wouldnt have gone through gate 2 until her house was built up</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: so you wouldnt fall to your death</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: but you got your cheat rocket so thats fine</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TG: see we all got to coordinate on this thing</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: wow, calm down!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i'm sorry, that's not really what i meant...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i mean, of course you're a real dave, but what i mean is...</span>
<br />

<br />
I never got to thank you properly for your gift. Yes, the words were there. Language comprising the familiar veneer of gratitude rubbing off with each tired favor traded for. A God bless to a sneeze or a few pennies cradled in a receipt. Perhaps it's the deplorable romantic in me, but I thought your present, and your friendship, demanded reciprocation surpassing by some degree the utterly meaningless.
<br />

<br />
The proper thanks I thought would be a demonstration that your offering was not in vain. Yes, maybe some would take your suggested alternative to my gloomy preoccupations as a passive-aggressive jab. But I know you didn't mean it that way. In fact, I'm sure reading about it now is the first time the notion has occurred to you. John, please stop rolling your eyes. The letter is down here.
<br />

<br />
The gift in this box is a resurrection. I used your present to thread life anew into a tattered heirloom. As long as I can remember, its black, greasy appendages have been tethered limply to its ratty, porous carriage. Too delicate to wash, too dear to discard. I used to love this rabbit. Now he's yours.
<br />

<br />
I trust you'll find this to be adequately sentimental. Happy birthday.
<br />

<br />
Rose</span><br><br><br>
 <b> 04/20/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003611">"John: Put the bunny back in the box."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This gift from Rose is so cool. Two sweet bunnies on one birthday?? What are the odds. In a fit of enthusiasm you SHUT UP AND JAM the bunny back in the box, executing a textbook CHAOS DUNK.
<br />

<br />
Millions would have perished, if everything in the ocean weren't dead already, that is.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/20/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003612">"John: Take box."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You gently CHAOS DUNK the fragile bunny back in the box and captchalogue it. It is such a nice present. You will have to write Rose a thank you note and tuck it under her hair band or something. Wait no, that would probably be creepy.
<br />

<br />
This bunny reminds you that you still have a salamander in your sylladex. She is holding the bunny Dave got you. It's sort of uncanny how similar they are, aside from the knitted enhancements. Seriously, what are the odds?? So weird.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/20/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003613">"John: Deploy beloved daughter."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You release dear, precious Casey. She was probably getting antsy in that card. You think you'll leave her here with Rose. A dangerous quest is nothing to embark on with a sweet, innocent little girl stashed in your inventory.
<br />

<br />
You aren't actually sure if she is a girl though. You don't even know if salamanders can be girls. Aren't they hermaphrodites or something?
<br />

<br />
You don't know anything about biology. Unless it is biology that has to do with ghosts and slime. But even then you don't actually know anything, you just sort of like to pretend you do.
<br />

<br />
Looks like a troll is bugging Rose.<br><br><br>

<br />
You are now the pony.
<br />

<br />
You stand outside some ruins which your beloved master's mother entered recently. Outside you find a striking scarcity of oats or greenery or anything at all that is delicious to chew on. This is as compelling a reason as any to follow her inside.<br><br><br>

<br />
You go in the ruins. Your clopping hooves echo throughout the cavernous and foreboding environment. But you are too stupid to be nervous. 
<br />

Your powerful snout detects the scent of Rose's MOM. She went this way.<br><br><br>

You pick up all the grist, and store it in Rose's GRIST CACHE. 
<br />

<br />
This is entirely too much grist of too many exotic types for such a low level player. But you'll take it. You don't look a gift horse in the pink heart tattoo.
<br />

<br />
The grist overflow is gathered by the GRIST GUTTER utility supplied by GRIST TORRENT. It is stored and gradually redirected to other players.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/22/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003627">"Maplehoof: Proceed."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Rose's MOM stands on a small platform and disappears.

<br />
You are a little nervous about transportalizing yourself. As a quadruped, grisly bisection strikes you as a very real possibility. Even though you're too dumb to think of such things.<br><br><br>

<br />
The thing is huge, and costs a fortune. Half a million pieces of BUILD GRIST, GARNETS, DIAMONDS, and GOLD, and a single piece of QUARTZ.

You use the alchemiter's scaling upgrade to reduce it to a more manageable and affordable size.

<br />
There's nothing to fix. Just got to open the viewport. It's easy.<br><br><br>

 <b> 04/23/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003647">"Rose: Examine laptop."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Someone has been using your Pesterchum account.
<br />

<br />
And you somehow doubt the culprit was this young upright amphibian presently throwing a fit.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/23/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003648">"Rose: Go find John."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You hurry to the door so you can catch John before he goes gallivanting off somewhere.
<br />

<br />
But it seems your door is ajar. Funny, you don't remember leaving your door ajar. Even though it's sort of absurd for you to take note of such a thing, considering John recently left your room. 
<br />

<br />
Oh well, it doesn't matter. You will now proceed through this door uneventfully.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/23/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003649">"Rose: Proceed through door uneventfully."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You get dumped on by a bucket full of HELLACIOUS BLUE PHLEGM ANEURYSM GUSHERS as a thoughtful but mischievous thank you gesture from John.
<br />

<br />
Your PRANKSTER'S GAMBIT plunges to an all time low. You cannot hope to defeat Egbert in a prank-off. He is simply the best there is.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003650">"John: Equip trusty rocket."</a></b><br><br>

Rose obviously isn't waking up any time soon. Might as well take some time to explore, and maybe stop by again later.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003651">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Why, Doctor Meowgon... do you want to come along for the ride? It sure looks that way.

Ok, hop aboard then. Adventure awaits.<br><br><br>

<br />
Where is he off to now?
<br />

<br />
At least you have this little fellow here to keep you company.
<br />

<br />
You will name him Viceroy Bubbles Von Salamancer.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003655">"Dave: Be the puppet."</a></b><br><br>

Ok, this is the most ridiculous thing you have ever seen. What is taking place here is almost certainly illegal.
<br />

<br />

 <b> 04/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003662">"John: Investigate."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 04/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003663">"John: Enter."</a></b><br><br>

There are many frightening and powerful monsters in here.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003664">"John: Aggress."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You fail to resist the urge.
<br />

<br />
You start thrashing up stunts something uncannybrutal on your quest for &quot;MAD JUSTICE YO&quot; and get this way rude municipality under control. Shit is basically flying off the hook. It's like shit wants nothing to do with that hook. The hook filed for divorce from that shit and is now seeking custody of the hook and the shit's two kids.<br><br><br>

<br />

<br />
He asks if you're still wearing that ridiculous outfit. He says you don't have to anymore, by orders of the SOVEREIGN SLAYER.

You say you'd still rather wear the outfit.

Speaking of naps, you have been asleep for some time yourself. You suppose you'd better wake up soon.

But then, your neighbor in the other tower is supposed to be waking up soon too, and it sure would be a shame if you weren't around to greet him!<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003720">"Dave: Wake up and jam."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Whoa your house is huge suddenly.

Anyway let's get this party started.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003721">"Dave: Combine sunglasses and iPhone."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make a pair of iSHADES.

<br />
This one was really obvious cause future Dave had a pair, but he took them with him when he prototyped himself. But now you have a pair too so that's cool.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003722">"Dave: Combine timetables and computer."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make the TURNTOP.
<br />

<br />
Convenient computing on the go. Sort of like you have with your iSHADES, but with all your important files and apps on there. Not to mention Sburb.
<br />

<br />
Plus MAYBE it has some weird time powers??? You have no idea. You'll mess with it later.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003723">"Dave: Combine puppet tux + smuppet."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You upgrade the PUPPET TUX future Dave made. He probably made it by combining one of your BRO'S badass marionette suits with your shirt, and scaling it up to fit. That's how you would have made it anyway.
<br />

<br />
You add a SMUPPET to the mix to make a softer and more stylish RED PLUSH PUPPET TUX. It is like walking around in snugly pajamas. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">ACTION PAJAMAS.</span><br><br><br>
 <b> 05/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003724">"Dave: Combine broken Caledscratch and ruby contraband."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You combine a couple more items you got from future Dave's loot stash. The broken form of CALEDSCRATCH, and some RUBY CONTRABAND, whatever the hell that is.
<br />

<br />
The resulting item costs a fortune. You have no idea what it is.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003725">"Dave: Preview item with holopad."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You momentarily reconfigure your alchemiter upgrades to make use of the HOLOPAD EXTENSION. You pop the card in the slot and check it out.
<br />

<br />
The combination would produce the BROKEN SCARLET RIBBITAR.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003726">"Dave: Combine whole Caledscratch and ruby contraband."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Out of curiosity you try it again with a whole sword.
<br />

<br />
You dial back CALEDSCRATCH'S little turntable, rewinding the sword to a point in its history before it was broken. You then combine it with the red frog thingy to show the complete SCARLET RIBBITAR.
<br />

<br />
But there's no way you can afford to make that yet. It costs even more now. 
<br />

<br />
Maybe you'll stick to combining items around your house for now, rather than stuff from your future sylladex. It'll be less confusing that way, and probably less expensive.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003727">"Dave: Combine shitty sword and Hella Jeff drawing."</a></b><br><br>

This thing is so unspeakably shitty you are having a hard time even holding it.

 <b> 05/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003732">"Dave: Combine Gamebro Magazine and timetables."</a></b><br><br>

<br />

<br />

<br />
You think you remember this one from your BRO'S stash. It's a classic.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003733">"Dave: Combine batarang + Midnight Crew poster."</a></b><br><br>

<br />

 <b> 05/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003734">"Dave: Combine plush puppet tux + Midnight Crew poster."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make FOUR ACES SUITED.
<br />

<br />
You aren't really sure which one you like better. The red one is softer, while the black one is sort of stiff and starchy. Anyone wearing this suit is all business.
<br />

<br />
Maybe you'll switch it up as your mood dictates.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003735">"Dave: Combine plush puppet tux + Felt poster."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 05/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003736">"Dave: Combine smuppet and Felt poster."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make a JUTTING OUT AND IMPUDENT FELT PLUSH.
<br />

<br />
You do an acrobatic fucking pirouette off the handle and into his heart. And he, into yours.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003737">"Dave: Combine dead things in amber &amp;&amp; smuppet."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 05/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003738">"Dave: Combine dead things in amber || smuppet."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
For the sake of science, you ||-combine them instead of &amp;&amp;-combine.
<br />

<br />
You make an AMBER MUTANT SMUPPET ABOMINATION.
<br />

<br />
So cool. Now this is how you make shit work. Egbert and Lalonde should be taking notes.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003739">"Dave: Combine fetus in a jar and Mr. T puppet."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make the FOAM FETAL MR. T IN A JAR.
<br />

<br />
Another backbreaking victory for science.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003740">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You're looking pretty chill with your new freakshow entourage.
<br />

<br />
The underlings all look kind of put off by it though. You're kind of weirding them out.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/14/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003741">"Dave: Combine camera and captchalogue card."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make the CAPTCHAROID CAMERA.
<br />

<br />
You can use it to snap a ghost image of any object without captchaloguing it. Spits it out on a brand new captchalogue card every time. Could be a useful way to take a large inventory of anything you encounter without cluttering up your sylladex. Also for grabbing codes for stuff you can't ordinarily pick up.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/14/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003742">"Dave: Take photo of self."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You take one of your patented ironic cool guy self portraits.
<br />

<br />
Man. So cool.
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: red">thats really all there is to say on the matter</span><br><br><br>
 <b> 05/14/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003743">"Dave: Combine fetus in a jar and self portrait photo."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
That would apparently make DAVE'S BRAIN IN A JAR. Gross.
<br />

<br />
It costs a king's ransom though because of course the organ is virtually inimitable.
<br />

<br />
Doesn't stop you from captcharoiding its hologram though.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/14/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003744">"Dave: Captcharoid the hologram of your own brain."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Ok, that's probably the weirdest thing you've ever done, but ok.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/14/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003745">"Dave: Combine brain and SBaHJ drawing and captcharoid camera"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make the SBAHJIFIER. 
<br />

<br />
Finally, something useful.
<br />

<br />
It cost you -1000 units of ARTIFACT GRIST.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/14/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003746">"Dave: Try it out."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Looks like it automatically prints out a SBaHJ comic in some way related to whatever you take a picture of.
<br />

<br />
This should save you a lot of time. Specifically the five minutes it takes you to draw a comic. You're a busy guy.<br><br><br>

<span style="color: #b536da">Frigglish bothered his beard, as if unkinking a hitch in a long silk windsock. A more pedestrian audience would parse the exhibit as nervous compulsion. Behavior to petition contempt among the reasonable. He was however not surrounded by the reasonable, but the <span style="font-style: italic">wise</span>, a distinction in men that would forever be the difference in history's garland of treasured follies. As a matter of fact, his cadre of fellow wizards were all putting similar moves on their beards as well. The practice would evince thoughtfulness - sagacity, even - if they didn't do it all the time. Standing in line at the bank. Shooing squirrels from bird feeders. Few occasions were safe.
<br />

<br />
Zazzerpan inspected the clue. A single piece of evidence cradled in his coriaceous old man palms. It was a human bone, not striking in the tale it told alone so much as that told by the thousands like it festooning the marshy soil of the mass grave. The grisly expanse bore the texture of a decadent dessert, like one of Smarny's formidable custard trifles wobbled out on wheels for the holidays, to the dismay of a small nation.
<br />

<br />
&quot;You're certain of this?&quot; asked Frigglish. Despite what he was doing with his beard, he was, in fact, immersed in meaningful contemplation.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I am afraid I am becoming more so with each terrible tick groused by that gaudy timepiece slung around your neck.&quot; In case it wasn't clear, Frigglish wore a clock Zazzerpan didn't care for. It was magic. &quot;The massacre of Syrs Gnelph was not as written.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;What has you convinced it was the hand of our disciples in this blackness?&quot; Executus chimed in.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I believe... I...&quot; a fat face stammered, eyes darting with the guilt of a thief in the throes of an unraveling alibi. &quot;I can summon a... more <span style="font-style: italic">pressing</span> line of inquiry...&quot; No, Smarny. Nobody was in the mood for a sticky bundt loaf just now.
<br />

<br />
Zazzerpan's ears fell insubstantial to any line of inquiry, pastry-oriented or otherwise. His abstruse contour carved a pondering shape in the fog carpeting centuries-dead. His eleven contemporaries too embraced the muted consternation of their great Predicant Scholar. Few wizards kept sharper adumbratives or read them with such lucidity. When Zazzerpan treated men with silence it was seldom unrepaid by the wise and reasonable alike.
<br />

<br />
It was harrowing to entertain. Zazzerpan the Learned's storied Complacency of Wizards was marked for grander descendence. Disciples hand-picked, vetted by Ockite the Bonafide and tested by Gastrell the Munificent. The twelve sweetest, most studious children a pair of elderly eyes could give their sparkle. Not the ragged guttersnipe so oft-harvested by the common Obscenity, those vituperative little beggars with hearts to corrupt as dropped bananas brown. That these chosen youngsters would turn was not merely unthinkable, but something of a roundhouse to the temporal bones of the Upper Indifference's high chamber of Softskulled Prophets. 
<br />

<br />
His wisdom-savaged brow pruned further with recount of his many lessons to wouldbe successors. Lessons to advance humanity's elucidation and prosperity, an outcome this bleak trail now painfully obviated. There were few puzzles The Learned could not suspend and dissect in the recondite manifold beneath his extremely expensive pointy hat. Daring to pitch his cherished pupils in with the foul melange of history's rogues, the heretofore abstract scourge that built up civilizations with ungodly magic and tore them down with joyful malice, would prove an intellectual trespass to make his calcium-deficient bones quake.
<br />

<br />
And more daring yet was the only question that now mattered. Could a bunch of bearded, scraggly old men in preposterous outfits hunt them down? He didn't have an answer. Only a simple observation so blunt and uncharacteristically jejune for the lauded sage it was breathtaking in its selfevidency.
<br />

<br />
It looks like you already tried that.
<br />

<br />
Whoever took those books was a pretty cold blooded dude. 
<br />

<br />
You figure you'll cool it on the time travel for a while. Don't want to see the Dave corpses start to pile up. Especially if one of them winds up being you.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/16/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003764">"Dave: Throw yourself out the window."</a></b><br><br>

You ditch the body before Jade sees it. That would probably freak her out.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/19/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003765">"John: Press a button on the control panel."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You push one of the nearby buttons. It activates the upper right monitor. The view is locked on to a particular location on Earth at a particular date and time.
<br />

<br />
Whoever was in the lab appears to have recently calibrated this device.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/19/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003766">"John: Examine monitor."</a></b><br><br>

The monitor displays a town on the west coast of the United States. It appears to be your old neighborhood. But there is a factory there you do not recognize. The date is December 1st, 1995, a few months before you were born.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/19/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003767">"John: Zoom in."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 05/19/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003774">"John: Zoom in."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 05/19/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003781">"John: =&gt; SWITCH 2"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You switch again to a view of your neighborhood, on April 13th, 1996. It is the day of your birth. 
<br />

<br />
There is more real estate you do not recognize near the recently devastated baked goods facility. It is a shopping mall you have never seen before.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/19/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003782">"John: Zoom in."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
A professional lady and new mother has traveled from the opposite coast at the behest of a famous and wealthy scientist to study one of numerous recent celestial anomalies while he is on expedition.
<br />

<br />
She notices a meteor overhead, on collision course with a quaint family joke shop. A distinguished gentleman notices the lady and comes outside to greet her, oblivious to the threat above. The gentleman's mother remains inside, busying herself with a tall bookshelf, a ladder, and a rather hefty unabridged joke book.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/19/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003783">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 05/19/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003784">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

The gentleman discovers a clue. A powerful nose detects perfume. The lady has fled. The mystery deepens.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/19/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003785">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 05/19/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003786">"John: Press blue button."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You create a PARADOX GHOST IMPRINT of the professional lady. The sludge fills the final tube.
<br />

<br />
Once all the tubes are filled, an automated sequence begins to execute.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/19/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003787">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

Four young PARADOX CLONES are created.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/19/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003788">"John: There's one more button to push."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Ectobiology sure does involve a lot of button pushing. At least it does when you're a junior ectobiologist.

<br />
Your loyal assistant Dr. Meowgon is all over this one.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/19/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003789">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

One pair of tubes empties the sludge into the chamber below.

The other pair does as well.

You storm up your ECHELADDER to claim the coveted if difficult to pronounce rung: ECTOBIOLOBABYSITTER.

 <b> 05/20/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003792">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You surpass ONE MILLION BOONDOLLARS and trade them all in for a single whopping BOONBUCK. This is of course going directly into the college fund for these youngsters.

An old man has much to do before he returns to Earth, dies, gets stuffed by his adopted-yet-biological daughter-slash-grand-daughter, and stuck in front of a fireplace.

 <b> 05/23/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003810">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This thing is so completely illegal. 
<br />

<br />
How could this atrocity be floating out here unnoticed all this time?
<br />

<br />
You are going to throw whoever is responsible into the slammer.
<br />

<br />
You always call jail the slammer when you are extra angry at crimes.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/23/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003811">"AR?: Go in."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
There is a large elevator platform ahead.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/23/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003812">"AR?: Go down."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Below there is a dark cavernous room. 
<br />

<br />
Near the platform is a TIME CAPSULE. It has deployed a SEED, and waits for something to be deposited, and for the clock to be set.
<br />

<br />
It is all harmless enough. Still no sign of any perpetrators.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/23/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003813">"AR?: Search premises."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Deeper into the darkness of the room there is some complicated lab equipment. Again, nothing particularly unusual for this jurisdiction.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/23/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003814">"AR?: Examine equipment."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
There is a large monitor. Displayed on it is a small human girl in a fancy house. The date is April 21, 1910.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/23/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003815">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Eight days prior, the orphan girl was taken in by an aristocratic southern colonel and legendary humorist. He recovered the young lady from a crater where a bakery once stood, operated by the man's wife, a notable baked goods baroness.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/23/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003816">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
There is an explosion in the colonel's back yard. 
<br />

<br />
Land sakes alive, we are cooking with petrol now!<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/23/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003817">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The colonel and his new grand daughter investigate.
<br />

<br />
The impact site is where a dog house stood moments ago. It was the magnificent abode of the man's beloved pet, HALLEY.
<br />

<br />
He takes a belt from the old julep flask. He'd sooner perish himself than lose that dear animal.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/23/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003818">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
People would think reports of the man's death were greatly exaggerated.
<br />

<br />
But they weren't.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/23/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003819">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />

 <b> 05/23/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003821">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Ah ha! There's HALLEY. The youngsters adore their new guardian. Good dog. Best friend.
<br />

<br />
The young boy has difficulty pronouncing the name though. Sounds more like &quot;Harley&quot; when he says it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/23/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003822">"AR?: Fast forward."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Thirteen years later, the boy develops a taste for adventure. He and his guardian bid farewell. His sister is sad. She will be left all alone with the wicked pastry baroness. She can handle it, he tells her. He believes in her.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003823">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This all seems pointless to you, and immaterial to the crime that has been committed. 
<br />

<br />
Though you do find it odd that the appearifier target has been fixed over that especially stupid looking animal. 
<br />

<br />
You hear the elevator platform. Someone is coming.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003824">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It is a high ranking agent from your kingdom.
<br />

<br />
Could he be the man behind this crime? Could his intent be mutinous?
<br />

<br />
You know the agent to be far too dangerous to take into custody. You hide behind some equipment and observe.<br><br><br>

He appears to be holding some notebooks. Also what appears to be a pair of juice-stained envelopes.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003826">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Only one of the books is useful to him. The envelopes are useless. And he couldn't make it through more than a paragraph of the other book. Some weird thing about wizards. He discards them.
<br />

<br />
The spare notebook lands on the floor. The envelopes land in the SEED.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003827">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The TIME CAPSULE stores the seed, and on account of some default setting, is programmed to bloom several hundred million years from now.
<br />

<br />
The capsule then readies a new seed.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003828">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Would Speculate That If We Are Not By Now Then It Is Probably Not To Be</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Please Take Note Of The Subtle Scorn Underlying The Selection Of The Word Attempting</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Smart Rose Should Get A Kick Out Of That</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Smart Rose Is All About Subtle Scorn Isnt She</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Honestly, I was looking forward to playing along and reading your Dumb Rose script for our next conversation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But it turned out there was a perfectly logical explanation for it all.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'd love to explain in detail and cause some sort of time paradox.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But you see - and this revelation may be as startling as any -</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: One Which I Have Not Had Yet</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes, that is definitely a conclusion you have just now drawn.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The only thing left to do is ride out the next several conversations while you maintain that understanding.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And while I maintain the chilly facade you have grown to so enjoy from Smart Rose.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Which shouldn't be too difficult, because... have I mentioned?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm busy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Goodbye.</span>

<br />

<br />
From what i heartell youve been through a bit of an adventure by the time youre reading this. Thats so great. I love adventure and i would bet my bottom boonbuck you do too. I think we are birds of a feather john. I am pretty eager to meet you. Oh yeah i should have mentioned we are going to meet some day. I hear you like movies is that right john? I love movies too. Have you ever seen weekend at bernies? So friggin hilarious. Its hard to talk to jade about movies because she doesnt really know about movies but im sure you know that. Boooring. Ha ha just kidding jade you know i love you and i think youre a blast.
<br />

<br />
Okay speaking of jade we spent quite a long time working on this present for you. It was a big team effort. Okay i had to do quite a lot of arm twisting to get her to go along with helping me make such an oddball present for you and so well in advance. But i had my arm sort of twisted myself to get this going in the first place. But then she came around to the idea because she can see the future! Pretty amazing if you ask me. Itll all be clear later. Gadzooks with all this arm twisting ive been getting a good workout. We should wrestle when we meet john. I love to wrestle but i dont get a chance to wrestle with anyone that much. Do you like to get into fisticuffs john? Scrums and what not? Me too.
<br />

<br />
Anyway you should listen to jade from here on out john because she sure seems to know whats best for you. Whatever your adventure throws at you im sure shell tell you you can handle it. She believes in you.</span>

There is another page to this letter...<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/09/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003856">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
There is another letter from a different author...<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/09/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003857">"dear john,"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">dear john,
<br />

<br />
happy birthday!!!!!!! :D
<br />

<br />
even though its super late and you probably went through a lot of trouble to get it, i really hope this present cheers you up! you looked so sad while you were reading my letter. um... which is to say, the one you are reading now. i can explain!!!
<br />

<br />
you see, when i go to sleep, in my dreams i wake up on the moon of a planet called prospit. by now you must know about this place! i have lived there in my dreams most of my life and i made so many friends there over the years. and you were there too! but you were asleep. the fact that you are awake now i think means all my friends are in trouble. you are awake because it is your job to help them. we will both help them!
<br />

<br />
but ummm..... i know these things because while i was on the moon, whenever it passed through skaia i could see lots of things in the clouds. the past, the future, stuff about our friends, and stuff about you! now that you are awake, and apparently at the center of skaia (??? WOW!!!) you should be able to see stuff in the clouds too. maybe you already have!
<br />

<br />
about this present! my penpal helped me work on it. he included a letter too! hes really funny and silly, i like him a lot and i think you would too. it took a long time between the two of us. and sure the present looks like a fun and completely ridiculous thing to get, but it is also really important! you are getting it exactly when you need it most. maybe thats hard to believe but its true! i saw it happen already. i dont see everything john, and i definitely dont know everything thats going to happen. but when i do know something, i always try to do my best to help people in the future! when im supposed to that is. youll get the hang of it.
<br />

<br />
john i am REALLY looking forward to seeing you when you wake up!!!!! its been nice playing with my prospitian friends and all, but also kind of lonely knowing you were in the other tower sleeping and having lousy dreams. :( im not sure where i am when you are reading this but im sure ill make it down to where you are soon! (jeez how did you get down there??? oh well ill find out) i cant wait to fly around the moon with you and show you all my favorite places. itll be so much fun!!!!!!!!! :D

<br />
|RECAP LOG|
<br />
Picking up from where we left off...
<br />

<br />
I typed a really long recap. Then some other stuff happened.
<br />

<br />
GC (gallowsCalibrator) helped John fly to the second gate, which took him to Rose's world, LOLAR. He crashed into Rose's room, where he found her asleep. He snooped through her room, and Dave tricked him into giving him the code to duplicate Rose's writing journals. John opened the package Rose made for his birthday. It contained the bunny from Con Air, the same one John got from Dave, but older and dirtier, and modified with Rose's knitting. She'd had the bunny since she was very young.
<br />

<br />
John leaves Casey the salamander (Bubbles Viceroy Von Salamancer) in the room. He briefly speaks with GA (grimAuxiliatrix) from Rose's computer, and pretends to be Rose. She believes he is, triggering a convoluted series of conversations between her and the real Rose in both the past and future, in no particular order. GA gets help with her computer from TA (twinArmageddons) in time to see Rose at her computer, having woken up.
<br />

<br />
Before she woke up, Dream Rose was awake on Derse's moon. She now had memories from her future self's doomed alternate reality. She flew to Dream Dave's tower, and got his attention with a ball of yarn, causing real Dave to fall asleep. They had a dream dance party. Dream Rose threw Dream Cal out the window. Bro's rocket board caught Dream Cal. AR? followed the board and Cal to a transportalizer on Derse, which lead to a meteor lab in the veil.
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile on LOLAR, Rose's mom defeated a huge monster. The pony, Maplehoof, followed her and collected the grist windfall. Both mom and the pony then transported to the meteor lab. John's dad found a clean hat John had deposited into a parcel pyxis. Dad followed Jade's grandpa, who was carrying John's Sassacre book, into some ruins. They both transported to the meteor lab too. Meanwhile, John used the grist collected by the pony to make a normal sized version of a giant hammer, Fear No Anvil, which Davesprite gave him the code for. Dream Rose saw John on Dream Dave's computer, and woke up. She went out to see him, but he had already blasted off. He took the mutant kitten, Vodka Mutini (Doctor Meowgon Spengler), with him.
<br />

<br />
John found the ruins that mom and the pony went into. He went in and killed some powerful monsters with his new hammer. He transported to the meteor lab as well.
<br />

<br />
In the lab he found no one, except the pony. Some other stray items were on the floor. Dad's dirty hat, the Sassacre book, Dream Cal. He found some apparatus used to genetically engineer footsoldiers and agents for the white and black armies from chess piece DNA. He also found a junior ectobiologist's lab suit, and a series of terminals much like those the exiles would find in the far future. He would use this apparatus to create paradox clones of himself, his friends, and their guardians.
<br />
 
<br />
Meanwhile AR? surfed bro's rocket board to a different meteor containing the frog temple that would later root itself near Jade's island. Inside he found the same time capsule she would find later. He also found some more lab equipment used for ectobiology. This equipment would soon be used to create Becquerel, a mutated combination of the genes from an ordinary dog in the early 20th century, and the DNA code in one of Rose's journals. AR? hides in the lab when he hears one of Jack's henchmen, the Draconian Dignitary. DD is carrying Rose's duplicated journals which he stole from Dave, and Dave's beta which was used as a bookmark. He discards the beta into the time capsule. Millions of years later (from the capsule's perspective) Jade would retrieve that beta and use it to connect with Dave, allowing him to enter the medium.
<br />

<br />
Dave created the journal duplicates after an extensive alchemy binge. Rose too had a similar alchemy session, and both kids upgraded their weapons and gear. Rose made a pair of needlewands, crossed with her grimoire, and took up the art of dark magic. She used this magic to burn her journal, thus destroying the genetic code. She was advised to do so by the gods of the Furthest Ring, whom she was now able to communicate with in her dreams. The gods live far beyond the veil, and advise the children of the moon of Derse, and serve as the counterpart to the role Skaia plays for the children of Prospit's moon. They deemed the code which would inevitably be used to create Becquerel to be dangerous. 
<br />

<br />
Dave decided to destroy his copy too. But when he went back to his room, he discovered they were stolen. He also found his own dead body, which apparently was him from the very near future attempting to go back in time and stop the thief, DD. Dave decided not to attempt any more time travel, and disposed of the body. GC (gallowsCalibrator) discussed the matter with him, and pledged to help him by telling him his future along the way, so that he would not have to face the death of more future selves, or suffer the sort of embarrassment he went through while entering the medium. 
<br />

<br />
Previously unseen, the way Dave entered the medium was as follows. As the large meteor was bearing down on his city, Dave climbed the radio tower on top of his building with his broken sword in hand to reach the nest built by the Crowsprite. The sprite guarded the egg, which unknown to Dave, simply needed time to hatch before he could enter. The sprite pecked his head and he fell. He was saved by bro's rocket board. Meanwhile, bro was on top of the meteor, riding it as it descended. He used his sword to chop it in half, splitting it into two pieces, diverting the initial impact from their building to two separate impact sites. He thus bought a little more time for the egg to hatch, which it did, just before their location was consumed by the blasts.
<br />

<br />
On Prospit's moon, PM? prepared to depart for the Battlefield at the center of Skaia, to seek the king's counsel on what to do with the queen's ring. She was tailed by another of Noir's lackeys, the Courtyard Droll. CD picked her pocket and stole the ring. PM? departed via shuttle to Skaia. Dream Jade then clobbered CD, and recovered the ring. She tried it on, but its power has no effect on humans. Later, CD would travel to the Battlefield and continue tailing PM?.
<br />

<br />
The Battlefield is a planet at the center of Skaia. It undergoes a transformation with each player that enters the medium, and each new prototyped kernel introduced. It starts as a simple 3x3 chessboard with two kings in perpetual stalemate, and expands to a larger board and more exotic collection of pieces with the first player entering. Then it become a much larger cube with the second player. And then an even larger sphere, with oceans, trees, mountains and pastures with the third. It presumably will transform again with the fourth.
<br />

<br />
The armies of the black and white kingdoms duel there. Soldiers are airlifted from meteor facilities in the veil to supply the manpower. Enormous mutant chess-like monsters stalk the landscape. The two kings command their armies from the field. They each have a scepter that serves a similar purpose to the queens' rings. When activated, a scepter causes a king to be a giant, and bear the properties of all the prototypings. A king is able to deactivate a scepter, to hand it off to another so that they will not be affected in that way. When the black king captures the white king's scepter, the Reckoning begins. The Reckoning sends all the meteors in the veil toward Skaia, in stages. First the small ones, then gradually, the bigger ones, over a 24 hour period.
<br />

<br />
There was a Warweary Villein on the Battlefield who was a simple farmer and was tired of the conflict. WV? united a band of soldiers from both armies to lead a rebellion against the black king. Before they could attack the king, Jack Noir, now empowered by the black queen's ring, intercepted the coup. He destroyed the king's scepter, and killed the king. Jack then killed the entire rebellion army, sparing only WV?. Perhaps to leave a survivor to tell the story, or perhaps out of respect for a fellow mutineer. Only he knows. Meanwhile, PM? met with the white king. He disabled his scepter, and gave it to her along with his crown. PM? now had the crowns of the white king and queen, and the white scepter, but discovered she had misplaced the white queen's ring. Jack's muscle, the Hegemonic Brute, had been tailing the white king. HB then followed PM?, and attacked her. She dropped the scepter off a cliff. She would regroup and chop off HB's head with the regisword Jack gave her to kill the white monarchs. CD, who had been tailing both of them, recovered the white scepter, and delivered it to Jack. Jack used it to initiate the Reckoning, and would proceed to go on a more extensive rampage, devastating the Battlefield and Prospit.
<br />

<br />
Back in the meteor lab, John began the ectobiology session which appeared to have been prepared for him in advance by the guardians who had just been there. The four monitors were all locked onto the kids' guardians at certain points in time, each on the day of one of the kid's &quot;birth&quot;. On Jade's birthday, nanna was locked onto in John's neighborhood, by the Betty Crocker factory. The meteor carrying baby Jade crashed into the factory and destroyed it. Her grandpa, the owner of that factory, would adopt her. John's dad witnessed, and would spend years investigating. On Dave's birthday, grandpa was locked onto while he was on his yacht, pioneering the island for the first time. He was sailing with baby Jade. Overhead, there was the meteor carrying baby Dave, which would crash into bro's favorite record shop. On Rose's birthday, bro was locked onto as he stood over the crater where he would find baby Dave. He would give him a tiny pair of pointy shades. Overhead, there was a meteor carrying baby Rose, which would land in a lake and destroy it. Rose's mom would retrieve and adopt her. Months later, on John's birthday, mom would bring Rose to John's neighborhood to investigate the destruction of grandpa's factory, and related stellar phenomena. The target was locked on her. Dad came out of the family joke shop to greet her, leaving nanna inside. The meteor carrying baby John destroyed the shop, killing nanna. Dad would adopt John, and Rose's mom disappeared. Dad retrieved her scarf, and filed the clue away for his ongoing investigation.
<br />

<br />
John attempted (unwittingly) to appearify all four guardians. But since removing them from those moments would have caused a paradox, he instead paradoxified their ghost slime imprints. This slime was collected into two pairs of containers. One pair collected nanna and granpa's slime. The other pair collected mom and bro's. The device then created baby paradox clones of the four guardians. These babies would then later be sent back in time to become those guardians themselves.
<br />

<br />
Once those four clones were created, another sequence activated. The two pairs of slime tubes emptied into vats below. The nanna/grandpa slime mixed together, and separately, the mom/bro slime mixed together as well. An additional four paradox clones were created from those two slime concoctions. Baby John and Jade were created from the nanna/grandpa slime. Baby Rose and Dave were created from the mom/bro slime. These four babies would also go back in time to become the four kids, via meteors, in the sequence and on the dates listed above. 
<br />

<br />
All eight babies would each ride their own meteors, launched from the veil after Jack started the Reckoning, and into the defense portals deployed by Skaia to protect itself. The defense portals each lead to Earth, as Skaia defends itself, in a way, by sacrificing Earth. While most meteors are sent to the time period when the kids begin the game, many lead to a number of different time periods. Some thirteen years prior to the game (used by the kids), some nearly a century prior (used by nanna and grandpa), some millions of years ago (used, eventually, by the frog temple meteor), and some to the far future (used by the exiles). 
<br />

<br />
And all eight of them would travel with an object or animal. John with his Sassacre book, which would become the much older-looking family heirloom stored in dad's safe, with Nannasprite's inscription to John on it. Rose with the dirty bunny Dave gave John for his birthday. Dave with the pony, Maplehoof. Jade with the knit-repaired bunny Rose got John for his birthday, which Rose cherished since &quot;birth&quot;. Nanna with dad's dirty hat. Mom with Mutini (Meowgon). Grandpa with two flintlock pistols which older Grandpa left behind for him in the lab (which would eventually both wind up in Jade's room). And bro with Dream Cal, which would later be fitted with a new personalized shirt, and would become real Cal, the same doll that would haunt Dave's waking life, and consequently, his dreams.
<br />

<br />
All of these babies and their items would automatically be transported to their own meteors at the onset of the Reckoning. John made absolutely sure to give baby Rose and Jade their bunnies when he saw an opportunity to reenact a scene from one of his favorite movies, much to the dismay of a watching CG (carcinoGeneticist). 
<br />

<br />
While AR? was in the frog temple lab, he would see more of young nanna and grandpa's story. On 4/13, 1910, exactly 99 years prior to John's &quot;birth&quot;, baby nanna's meteor destroyed a bakery owned by Betty Crocker. Nanna was adopted by Crocker's husband, Colonel Sassacre, and taken to live in his mansion. 8 days later, grandpa's meteor destroyed the dog house belonging to Sassacre's dog, Halley. Halley was elsewhere, and was unharmed. When Sassacre and nanna went to investigate the crater, Sassacre was shot and killed accidentally with one of grandpa's pistols. Halley then showed up (who young grandpa would tend to pronounce &quot;Harley&quot; due to his speech impediment), and would largely serve as their guardian for the next 13 years, with presumably some parental influence from the wicked Crocker. On his 13th birthday, grandpa would run off with Harley to find adventure. Nanna would stay behind, contend with the batterwitch, and master the art of baking as well as take up her deceased grandfather's tradition of pranksterism.
<br />

<br />
Harley was locked onto by the frog temple's equipment. DD activated the device, and produced a paradox clone of Harley combined with the controversial MEOW code to create puppy Bec. The spectacle terrified AR?, leaving a major impression on him. He would recognize Bec's silhouette carved on WV's pumpkin years later. The pumpkin commanded his fear, and caused him to surrender.
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile, the grown-up versions of mom and dad were on board a flying battleship belonging to grandpa, who piloted it toward Skaia. Dad gave mom her long discarded scarf, from the day he lost his mother and found his son. The two guardians traded gestures of affection. 
<br />

<br />
Jade remained asleep through it all, trying to stay on the moon as long as she could until she figured out how to wake John up. She talked about this with AT (adiosToreador), who revealed he preferred his dream life on Prospit more than any aspect of the game, and regretted all the trolls' dream selves were now dead. Jade expressed surprise at the notion of dream self mortality.
<br />

<br />
After Jack used the full power of the ring to devastate the battlefield and the two armies, he turned his attention on Prospit, inflicting severe damage the same way. He then cut the chain connecting the moon to Prospit, sending the moon plummeting through the atmosphere of Skaia, and breaking up in the process. Dream John, still asleep, fell out of his tower and drifted down ahead of the falling moon. Dream Jade flew to intercept him, and spent a moment attempting to wake him before the moon's collision was imminent. At the last minute she flung Dream John out of the blast radius, but was not able to clear the blast herself. She died.
<br />

<br />
The blast left a massive crater on the Battlefield. This was the first thing Dream John saw when he woke up.
<br />

<br />
The death of Dream Jade caused her dreambot to malfunction and explode, destroying her room. Still asleep, Jade fell from her tower as Bec watched from a distance, and an enormous meteor loomed overhead.
<br />

<br />
Elsewhere, on Dave's world LOHAC, bro dueled with Jack briefly. It was a stalemate, until bro plunged his sword into the large floating record platform they were fighting on. This released a mysterious energy from the cracks. Bro escaped.
<br />

<br />
Rose completed her final GameFAQS walkthrough entry, and used magic to seal it in a server in the Furthest Ring, to be accessed by players in worlds beyond their own. She had destroyed her first gate on a whim, and resolved to search for answers to remedy the hopelessness of their doomed session. Meanwhile, Dave entered his first gate, riding into it with his awesome skateboard, Unreal Air.
<br />

<br />
The four exiles arrived on Earth years after its apocalypse, but years before they found their respective command stations. WV wrapped himself in John's dream blanket, which became dirty and unrecognizable over time. He found it along with a Jack-like doll on the Battlefield, which formerly sat in Dream John's bedroom, haunting his dreams. WV? ripped it apart. PM wrapped herself in a Prospit banner, which too faded in time. AR wrapped himself in caution tape, using his own supply, as well as some fresh rolls he was lucky enough to discover near the ruined frog temple in one of grandpa's old crates. This was after he escaped that same temple in the medium, and found the meteor lab in which John slept. That meteor then took off for Skaia, via the Reckoning. AR? taped John to the rocket board, and cast him off before the meteor went through a portal. Thus AR became exiled. WQ exiled herself with an entourage on a royal cruiser, and landed on Earth. She departed on a solo quest, leaving her people to their own devices. She discovered her command station, a large egg, broken in two pieces in the two large craters made by Dave's split meteor. She used a key to repair the egg station, and teleported to the present location of the exiles, the frog ruins at night, 413 years after the apocalypse of Earth.
<br />

<br />
On the Battlefield, Dream John found Dream Jade's body. He was sad and confused, and took her ring as a keepsake. Later, grandpa would land his ship on the Battlefield, find and recover her body, and use it to create a stuffed trophy as a memorial, as per the proud family tradition. He would depart in his ship, and leave mom and dad behind.
<br />

<br />
John saw a vision in a cloud directing him where to go. It was a castle where he would rendezvous with PM?. PM?, after beheading HB, used his radio to summon Jack. He came, and she traded the two white crowns for the green box, Jade's present to John. He appeared pleased to uphold the bargain, either out of the misunderstanding that he was still under control of its contents, or out of respect for PM?'s tenacity and brutality in pursuing the prize. Only he knows.  
<br />

<br />
PM? delivered the package to John, and then left, not thrilled by the trials caused by its recovery. John opened it to find letters from Jade, and her pen pal, who helped her make the present for him over several years. The gift was the pen pal's idea, and he himself was coerced into the plan by someone else. The box contained a modified version of the stuffed bunny John had received for his birthday twice already. it was the same knit-repaired bunny John sent back in time with baby Jade, and she presumably kept it as a cherished childhood toy ever since. It was now upgraded with mechanical parts, fully mobile and autonomous. It was also included with four powerful weapons, the Royal Deringer (broken sword), the Quills of Echidna (wands), Ahab's Crosshairs (rifle), and the Warhammer of Zillyhoo (hammer). Each was shrunken down to be &quot;bunny sized&quot;.
<br />

<br />
As John mourned Jade's death over her letter, he was interrupted by Jack's sword. Jack was after the ring. But the heavily-armed mechanical bunny intervened, recognizing John as its new master. Jack, knowing the danger of the toy, was forced to retreat. 
<br />

<br />
Finally, a cloud showed John what he was supposed to do with the ring. It was held by a mysterious black hand. In the far future on Earth, the exiles gathered around Exile Town. WQ asked WV for something. WV revealed he had been storing the complete, quad-prototyped ring in the sleeve of his Trusty Knife. It had been there all along, much to Serenity's surprise.
<br />

<br />

All these great designs were by <a href="http://rendigo.tumblr.com/post/60450019230/my-beta-kids-shirts-are-officially-up-for-sale-in" target="_blank">Rennie Kingsley</a>. Alpha kid designs by the same artist will be coming soon too.

<br><br>

There will be so many other cool things hitting WP this fall, I honestly couldn't list them all off the top of my head. Just keep refreshing the site constantly. Even in your sleep. Then you will be ok.
