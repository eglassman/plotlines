<br />
Elsewhere in paradox space, we examine another planet, forgotten by time.
<br />

<br />
But we will strive to remember. What was this planet's name?<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003890">"Enter name."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Oh, ha ha! Nice one, smartypants. Really hilarious.
<br />

<br />
But let's get real here. No more clowning around.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003891">"Try again."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
That is much better. In fact, as it happens, your guess is precisely correct. What are the odds??
<br />

<br />
We examine the planet ALTERNIA. Somewhere on this planet, there is a young troll.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003892">"Hivebent"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This young troll stands in his respiteblock. It just so happens that today, the 12th bilunar perigee of the 6th dark season's equinox, is the day of this young troll's larval awakening, also known as his wriggling day. Though it was six solar sweeps ago he was given life, it is only today he will be given a name!
<br />

<br />
Six Alternian solar sweeps, for convenient reference, is equivalent to thirteen Earth years.
<br />

<br />
Earth, also for convenient reference, is a planet that does not yet exist.
<br />

<br />
What will the name of this young troll be?<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003893">"Enter name."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You enter something predictably derogatory and this guy gets fed up by your shenanigans in record time.
<br />

<br />
This guy has a lot of troll pals and their adventures are going to be quite extensive and convoluted, to an even greater degree than one perhaps may be accustomed. He thinks that if you think that we have time to drag out every little gag and expected pattern along the way, you've got another thing coming. He thinks you should cram that sobering understanding in your chitinous windhole, and tamp it down hard with your ugly stupid looking cartilage nub.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003894">"Try again."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your name is KARKAT VANTAS. As was previously mentioned, it is your WRIGGLING DAY, which is barely even worth mentioning. It is an anniversary, if anything, to lament the faults of your existence, of which there are assuredly plenty. 
<br />

<br />
Equally plenty, and somewhat related to that topic, are your INTERESTS. You have a passion for RIDICULOUSLY TERRIBLE ROMANTIC MOVIES AND ROMCOMS. You should really be EMBARRASSED for liking this DREADFUL CINEMA, but for some reason you are not. You like to program computers, but you are NOTORIOUSLY PRETTY AWFUL AT IT. Your programs invariably damage the machines on which they are executed, which is just as well, since you like to believe you specialize in COMPUTER VIRUSES. When you mature, you aspire to join the ranks of the most lethal members of your society, the THRESHECUTIONERS. You like to practice with your REALLY COOL SICKLE, but just wind up looking like KIND OF A DOOFUS BY YOURSELF IN YOUR ROOM.
<br />

<br />
You like to chat with some of your other troll pals, most of which drive you BATSHIT UP THE FUCKING BELFRY. You have been trying out a new chat client beta called TROLLIAN, and you are NOT REALLY SURE WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT IT YET. Your trolltag is <span style="color: #626262">carcinoGeneticist</span> and you speak in a manner that is <span style="color: #626262">ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ORNERY, ALL THE TIME.</span>
<br />

<br />
Later, you will play a game with 5 other friends, and go on a big adventure with them. This game, for convenient reference, is a game that DOES NOT YET EXIST.
<br />

<br />
But it will soon.
<br />

<br />
What will you do?<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003895">"Karkat: Examine slimy purple pod."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It is your RECUPERACOON full of nourishing SOPOR SLIME. Every young troll enjoys the cozy embrace of such a vessel each night, and the relaxing ooze helps assuage the terrible visions of blood and carnage that plague the dark subconscious of your species.
<br />

<br />
It is so inviting... a few minutes couldn't hurt.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003896">"Karkat: Get in."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Ok, this sure is cozy and all, but you can't be napping all day like a chump. Dammit, you're a busy guy. You are sort of a big deal.
<br />

<br />
Goddamn slime. Now you have to change your clothes too. What were you thinking?
<br />

<br />
Luckily all your clothes are the same. Trolls think fashion is stupid.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003897">"Karkat: Examine movie posters."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Ok, it's time to get serious here.  Sweet Troll Jegus. Let's get real and get down to some major business.
<br />

<br />
You space out and get caught up reading the titles of the films for about five minutes. Wow these movies are great. You don't care what anyone says. Pure magic.
<br />

<br />
Is that...
<br />

<br />
Is that John Cusack?
<br />

<br />
The thing that most people don't realize is that John Cusack is a universal constant.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003898">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This movie...
<br />

<br />
Ok, this one even you have a hard time defending. But still, it's so good.
<br />

<br />
The best thing about it is how Troll Sandler doesn't make you want to punch anything.
<br />

<br />
Like, nothing at all, really hard or anything.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003899">"Karkat: Captchalogue sickle."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You grab your trusty SICKLE with your ENCRYPTION MODUS. To retrieve it, you'll need to hack the code to open the CARD VAULT left behind.
<br />

<br />
This will obviously prove to be a completely ridiculous and untenable way of managing an inventory, and lead to a great many follies. Later on, you would swap your modus with your hacker friend, a guy who unlike you happens to be competent with programming. It would only make sense.
<br />

<br />
But for the time being it makes your life kind of a nightmare. There are so many stupid things that happen because of this modus. So many, you just have no idea.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003900">"Karkat: Take card vault."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
GOD.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">DAMMIT.</span>
<br />

<br />
You hear some unhappy grumbling through the hole below. This was not the coolest thing you could have done just now.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003901">"Karkat: Examine large black book."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make quite sure NOT to captchalogue it, and simply pick it up and read it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003902">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It is a thick programming manual called &quot;~ATH - A HANDBOOK FOR THE IMMINENTLY DECEASED.&quot;
<br />

<br />
~ATH is an insufferable language to work with. Its logic is composed of nothing but infinite loops, or at best, loops of effectively interminable construction.
<br />

<br />
The above page in the intro section documents the simplest possible ~ATH code structure. Any code deviating from this basic structure will not compile.
<br />

<br />
You have a whole bunch of code samples you've been messing around with on your computer. It's been frustrating at best, and debilitating to your machine at worst.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003903">"Karkat: Leave your room."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You step outside your respiteblock, onto one of your hive's numerous extraterraneal landing slats. You were allowed to design this hive when you were young, after you emerged victorious from your trials deep in the brooding caverns. You have lived here with your CUSTODIAN ever since.
<br />

<br />
It's almost as if your people have placed great cultural importance on teaching children to become architecturally adept while very young. It has been this way since ancient times. No one seems to know why that is.
<br />

<br />
Getting to build your own hive at a young age using whatever meandering design you chose likely has left you jaded to the notion of customizing your abode. You certainly wouldn't get all that worked up about a game that happened to allow you to do such a thing.
<br />

<br />
At least not for that reason.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/14/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003904">"Karkat: Examine neighborhood."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The lawnrings are empty. Blood skims the voids in your porous cranial plates, as if grazing the hollow of a threshed stem, or say, an abandoned cocoon. A sour note is produced. It's the one Agitation plays to make its audience squirm.
<br />

<br />
It is your sixth wriggling day, and as with all five preceding it blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
<br />

<br />
Look.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/14/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003905">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You don't have time for fancy poetry. It's almost as useless as those arm-swing flappy things on mailboxes, assuming you even knew what those were, which you don't. Trolls don't have mail. Mail is almost as useless as poetry to them. Poetry is the swing arm flappy dealy of words, and mail is the red tilty lever doodad of giving people shit.
<br />

<br />
Frankly you don't know about things skimming voids or grazing hollows or whatever. You've got AMBITION. You were meant to be a bigshot. To be in charge of something huge and really important, and to be totally ruthless about it. You just haven't found the dominion in which you're destined for greatness yet. Or even a vague concept of it. You haven't found your purpose. But you will tonight.
<br />

<br />
You stew in your own impotent aggravation in the cool dusk breeze. During the dark seasons, it remains dusk for most of the day. It can stay dark for many bilunar perigees at a time. But even if it didn't, you would still have this feeling...
<br />

<br />
You have a feeling it's going to be a long night.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/14/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003906">"Karkat: Go back inside."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You head back into your block and hit up your computer station. No word from any of your loudmouth pals. No news is good news. Sweet music to your auricular sponge clots.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/14/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003907">"Karkat: Check out magazine."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It's the latest issue of GAME GRUB.
<br />

<br />
This one appears to boast about &quot;exclusive leaks&quot;. They all boast about that. You're not even really sure what it means.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/14/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003908">"Karkat: Check out DVD."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It is a DVD of one of your favorite series, THE THRESH PRINCE OF BEL-AIR.
<br />

<br />
It's about a green threshecutioner cadet who sasses up the bluebloods in his flaysquad pretty good. Their blood is literally blue. Lousy snobs. But Troll Will Smith shows them all how to loosen up. He is pretty much your hero. 
<br />

<br />
Troll TV shows have shorter titles than troll movies because TV is a much newer form of media in their society. Which is a good thing because it would be pretty hard to make this funny joke otherwise.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/14/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003909">"Karkat: Get down to business on computer."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Ok enough messing around time to get some work done maybe a little programming or oh god. 
<br />

<br />
It figures that installing this new beta chat client would open the floodgates. All your moron friends are going to be hounding you relentlessly. Not that they needed an excuse before.
<br />

<br />
You wonder what this chump wants.<br><br><br>

<br />
Your name is GAMZEE MAKARA. 
<br />

<br />
You get pretty excited by CLOWNS OF A GRIM PERSUASION WHICH MAY NOT BE IN FULL POSSESSION OF THEIR MENTAL FACULTIES. You belong to a RATHER OBSCURE CULT, which foretells of a BAND OF ROWDY AND CAPRICIOUS MINSTRELS which will rise one day on a MYTHICAL PARADISE PLANET that does not exist yet. The beliefs of this cult are SOMEWHAT FROWNED UPON by those dwelling in more common lawnrings. But you don't care, you got to be going with what feels right at where your heart's up in, you know? You like to practice on your ONE WHEEL DEVICE, which you are GOD AWFUL AT because your FEET DO NOT REACH THE PEDALS. You enjoy a FINE BEVERAGE, and like to do A LITTLE BAKING SOMETIMES. You've got ALL THESE HORNS all over the place, and sometimes you step on them and SCARE THE SHIT OUT OF YOURSELF. 
<br />

<br />
You like to chat a lot with your pal Karkat, who is usually pretty cranky, but he is your BEST FRIEND. You have a lot of OTHER GREAT FRIENDS who you also like a lot. Your trolltag is <span style="color: #2b0057">terminallyCapricious</span> and you speak in a manner that is <span style="color: #2b0057">JuSt A lItTlE bIt WhImSiCaL.</span>

You snag a bottle of FAYGO. To consume the beverage is what your fellow devotees refer to as KICKIN' THE WICKED ELIXIR. 
<br />

<br />
It is captchalogued through your MIRACLE MODUS. You have absolutely no idea how this thing works.

 <b> 06/15/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003915">"Gamzee: Ride one wheel device."</a></b><br><br>

You decide to give this diabolical contraption another shot. Maybe one of these days you will get one more suited to your proportions. For now this is all you have to work with.
<br />

<br />

<br />
You aren't supposed to eat that slime. It does funny things to a troll's head.
<br />

<br />
But you were never taught that on account of a lousy upbringing. Your custodian was always out to sea.
<br />

<br />
That is where he is now. Maybe you will go outside and see if you can spot him.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/15/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003918">"Gamzee: Take a juggling club."</a></b><br><br>

You grab a JUGGLING CLUB. You'll need it if you are going to go out. It is dangerous to leave unarmed.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/15/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003919">"Gamzee: Go outside."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You leave your hive and head out to the beach. There is no sign of your custodian. 
<br />

<br />
You should not stay out here very long. The SEA DWELLERS are quite hostile.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/15/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003920">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Someone is bugging you. This is exciting. You're always down for shooting the wicked shit with anyone that who'll put up with you.
<br />

<br />
Now if only you could figure out how to get your HUSKTOP out of this stupid thing. It'll be a miracle if you can manage.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/15/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003921">"Gamzee: Retrieve husktop."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Finally some peace and quiet. Now you can bear down on your coding. This will surely last all evening, without interruption.
<br />

<br />
You reopen one of your ~ATH projects you started recently. You are still horsing around with the conditions for terminating the loops.
<br />

<br />
What many ~ATH coders do is import finite constructs and bind the loops to their lifespan. For instance the main loop here will terminate on the death of the universe, labeled U. That way you only have to wait billions of years for it to end instead of forever.
<br />

<br />
You have bound a subloop to the lifespan of the code's author, which is you. Any routine at the end will execute when you die. You figure this might be handy for coding something to release a final will and testament. Or maybe some doomsday virus. You spend a lot of time thinking of ways to make the perfect doomsday virus.
<br />

<br />
Conveniently absent from ~ATH's extensive import library are entities with short lifespans. Like a rapidly decaying particle that only lasts a millisecond sure would be handy. Or even a fruit fly or something. But no, coding with this language is all about finding ways to trick it into doing what you want.
<br />

<br />
Your hacker buddy is obnoxiously good at it. He's sent you some files which you still don't understand, but you're not going to admit that. He is even better at making viruses than you, which really gets stuck in your nook.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/16/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003926">"Karkat: Check out one of his files."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This code, when executed, immediately causes the user's computer to explode, and places a curse on the user forever, along with everyone he knows, and everyone he'll ever meet. 
<br />

<br />
Not surprisingly, later on you would run this code in a fit of stupidity.
<br />

<br />
You don't know how he does stuff like this. What does this even mean? It's nonsense. Is it even syntactically viable?? Are you allowed to color text like that??? ARGH. Maybe you should ask him about it some time.
<br />

<br />
Oh speak of the devil. Here he is bugging you about something. Time to put on your game face and pretend you don't think very highly of his abilities.<br><br><br>

Sounds like someone downstairs is getting pretty crabby. This is not an encounter you are looking forward to. You'll probably put it off as long as you can manage.<br><br><br>

Why, who's this young lady?<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/16/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003931">"Enter name."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your name is TEREZI PYROPE. 
<br />

<br />
You are pretty enthusiastic about dragons. But you have a PARTICULAR AFFECTION for their COLORFUL SCALES, which you gather and use to decorate your hive. Though you live alone, deep in the woods, you surround yourself with a variety of plushie pals known as SCALEMATES. You often spend your days with them in rounds of LIVE ACTION ROLE PLAYING. You used to engage in various forms of MORE EXTREME ROLEPLAYING with some of your other friends before you had an accident. 
<br />

<br />
You take an interest in justice, holding particular fascination for ORCHESTRATING THE DEMISE OF THE WICKED. You have taken up study of BRUTAL ALTERNIAN LAW, and surround yourself with legal books. You have no need for copies printed in TROLLBRAILLE, because you can SMELL AND TASTE THE WORDS. You hope one day to join the honorable ranks of the LEGISLACERATORS. Your trolltag is <span style="color: #008282">gallowsCalibrator</span> and you <span style="color: #008282">SP34K W1TH TH3 NUM3R4LS TH3 BL1ND PROPH3TS ONC3 US3D.</span>
<br />

<br />
You are presently the leader of the RED TEAM, poised to begin a mysterious game with 5 other friends, in direct competition with another 6 of your friends, comprising the BLUE TEAM. 
<br />

<br />
What will you do?<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/17/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003932">"Terezi: Cut to the chase and begin LARPing immediately."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It's pretty hard to live action role play when there is no one who is alive nearby. But all of your Scalemates are alive to you.
<br />

<br />
At least you pretend to believe that to annoy people.
<br />

<br />
You prepare a new campaign for one of your favorite scenarios, COURTBLOCK DRAMA. His HONORABLE TYRANNY presides. On trial is an especially detestable fellow, SENATOR LEMONSNOUT. You have sparred with this scumbag before. Tonight he faces justice.
<br />

<br />
You will play the role of the prosecuting attorney. On Alternia, there is no such thing as a defense attorney, or a defense. In a courtblock, the word defense itself is offensive.<br><br><br>

<br />
You don't want to slap too hard. Enough to sting, but not to bruise. It must be methodical, business-like. And persistent. You only stop when you smell tears.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/17/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003938">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Mr. Senator, you smell very nice. Your luscious yellow scales are like the sweetest gumdrops to the prosecution's nose.
<br />

<br />
But your deceit <span style="font-style: italic">STINKS</span>.
<br />

<br />
Did you honestly think you could dip your corpulent snout into the imperial beetle coffers like that and get away with it?? Did you think your revolting abuse of the public trust would go unnoticed??? <span style="font-style: italic">THINK AGAIN, GOOD SENATOR.

Oh, well played, Lemonsnout. <span style="font-style: italic">Well played.</span> The prosecution's key witness, murdered. <span style="font-style: italic">How convenient!</span> The courtblock has little choice but to acknowledge your cunning. You have earned just a teensy sliver of your respect back. For now.
<br />

<br />
But wait...<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/17/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003940">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Oh my!
<br />

<br />
What have we here???<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/17/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003941">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The prosecution begs your pardon, dear senator, but you appear to have dropped something. A personal satchel, perhaps? <span style="font-style: italic">CHOCK FULL OF ILLICIT, EMBEZZLED BEETLES, WITH WHICH YOU HAVE THE UNMITIGATED CHEEK TO WALTZ BEFORE HIS TYRANNY, CONCEALED BENEATH YOUR ILL-GOTTEN FINERY??????</span>
<br />

<br />
The prosecution requests a short recess from His Honorable Tyranny so that all law abiding and Mother Grub fearing citizens may go outside and <span style="font-style: italic">puke</span>.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003942">"Terezi: Sentence the criminal."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
As the prosecutor, it is your job to reach a final verdict and sentence the reprehensible felon, while His Tyranny watches in silence and submits grim approval.
<br />

<br />
But you take pity on this miserable bureaucrat. You are feeling merciful. You will give him a fighting chance.
<br />

<br />
You will flip a DOUBLE-HEADED TROLL CAEGAR to decide his fate. You do this quite often when making important decisions. Kind of like Batman's nemesis, Two-Face. Or that guy from No Country for Old Men. It turns out there are lots of badasses out there flipping coins. But those are Earth things and you've never heard of them. It's safe to say you borrowed this gimmick from one of the many, many troll things out there that's got hard boiled dudes flipping coins for major stakes. You base the habit on whichever one smells the most badass.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003943">"Terezi: Flip."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The coin tumbles through the air. Lemonsnout is sweating bullets!!!<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003944">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
A favorable flip. The senator exhales in relief.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003945">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
But, what are you so happy about, Mr. Lemonsnout?
<br />

<br />
He looks a bit confused. He quivers his lowly proboscis at the coin. 
<br />

<br />
See? The coin has exonerated him.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003946">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Coin? What coin?
<br />

<br />
Surely you jest, Mr. Senator. The prosecution sees no coin.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003947">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">SHE'S BLIND, REMEMBER?</span><br><br><br>
 <b> 06/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003948">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003949">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003950">"Terezi: Adjourn."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Another triumph for justice. The courtblock is adjourned. You offer final salutations to His Tyranny in the customary manner.
<br />

<br />
Ok, that's not customary at all. You're just kind of weird.
<br />

<br />
It's just that your red chalk is THE MOST DELICIOUS CHALK. You cannot get enough of it. Anyone who says there is a more delicious chalk out there simply reeks of deceit.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003951">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You sure had to go to a lot of trouble to do that.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/19/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003952">"Terezi: Go get cane."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You take your WALKING CANE, which you use as a weapon kind of like Earth Daredevil who you've never heard of. You will use it to wallop enemies when you enter the Medium.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/19/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003953">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Like this.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/19/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003954">"Terezi: Begin recruiting red team members."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your nose begins scouring your chumproll through the saliva smears on your monitor for potential teammates so you can start playing. Hmm, no not her. Nope, not her either. DEFINITELY not that guy.
<br />

<br />
Ok how about this girl. You like to roleplay with her sometimes via chat. You pretend you are a member of the mysterious and noble DRAGONYY'YD RACE, while she does her own goofy thing. 
<br />

<br />
You don't have it in your heart to tell her that your chat RPing is meant f4c3t1ously I mean facetiously.<br><br><br>

<br />
You go downstairs and confront your custodian, which is another term for a frightening beast known as a LUSUS NATURAE.
<br />

<br />
Your lusus has looked after you since you were very young in lieu of any biological parents, whom you have never known. No young troll ever knows his or her blood parents, nor could such lineage ever be accurately traced. Adult trolls supply their genetic material to the FILIAL PAILS carried by imperial drones and offered to the monstrous MOTHER GRUB deep underground in the brooding caverns. She then combines all the genetic material into one diabolical incestuous slurry, and lays hundreds of thousands of eggs at once.
<br />

<br />
The eggs hatch into young larval trolls which wriggle about to locate a cozy stalactite from which to spin their cocoons. After they pupate, the young troll with his or her newfound limbs undergoes a series of dangerous trials. If they survive, they are chosen by a member of the diverse and terrifying subterranean monster population native to Alternia. This creature becomes the troll's lusus, and together they surface and choose a location to build a hive. The building process is facilitated by CARPENTER DROIDS left on the planet to cater to the young. But only for building. They're on their own otherwise.
<br />

<br />
The vast majority of adult trolls are off-planet, serving some role in the forces of ongoing imperial conquest, besieging other star systems in the name of Alternian glory. The culture and civilization on the homeworld is maintained almost entirely by the young.
<br />

<br />
Trolls sure are weird!<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/21/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003970">"[S???] ======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You leap into the domestic fray in an attempt to mollify your nannying aggressor. After a lot of kicking and fussing and gnashing of teeth and carapace, you just pull out a few CHILLED ROE CUBES from the fridge to settle the beast down.
<br />

<br />
Trolls and their custodians have a peculiar arrangement of codependence. The lusus behaves as a lifelong bodyguard, caretaker, and visceral sort of mentor, while the young troll must learn to function as a sort of zookeeper.
<br />

<br />
We decide to agree this conflict is not a big enough deal to warrant a detailed examination of the action, or an embedded musical accompaniment. We also agree that while that would have been pretty sweet, we are also in kind of a hurry here. But if it were to be accompanied by something audible, <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/showdown.mp3" target="_blank" class="postlink">it would probably sound something like this</a>. We decide to listen to that track, close our eyes, and imagine what might have been.

There's this pretty cool dude, ok? Some people seem to think he's cool. Sometimes. He guesses they're right. I mean, maybe. If they say so. Actually, you know what? They're right. This guy's dynamite lit in a box of hot shit. Screw the haters. Anyway, he's standing around being all chill, like cool dudes are known to do sometimes, when they're not moping around or nursing migraines or whatever. A cool dude like this probably has a real cool name. Or at least a name that doesn't completely fucking suck. Like at least not the kind of name that belongs to someone you'd want to just perpetually wail on. Maybe just a name that makes you cringe a little, but you guess you can deal with it if you've got to. It's just a guy's name, it's not like it really matters. Who cares? But he probably wouldn't just tell you what it was if you asked. He'd be way too moody for that. In fact, this guy probably thinks you've got some attitude and probably doesn't want a damn thing to do with you. 
<br />

<br />
You could always try to guess his name. But instead of that, here's a better idea. Why don't you just fuck off and go to hell?

It appears this cool and moody dude had a change of heart. He feels pretty bad about flying off the handle like that, as if shit wanted nothing to do with the handle. Shit would like to reconcile with the handle, and perhaps seek marital counseling. 
<br />

<br />
So what's his name gonna be?<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/22/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003976">"Enter name."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your name is SOLLUX CAPTOR. 
<br />

<br />
You are apeshit bananas at computers, and you know ALL THE CODES. All of them. You are the unchallenged authority on APICULTURE NETWORKING. And though all your friends recognize your unparalleled achievements as a TOTALLY SICK HACKER, you feel like you could be better. It's one of a number of things you SORT OF BEAT YOURSELF UP ABOUT for NO VERY GOOD REASON during sporadic and debilitating BIPOLAR MOOD SWINGS. You have a penchant for BIFURCATION, in logic and in life. Your mutant mind is hounded by the psychic screams of the IMMINENTLY DECEASED. Your visions foretell of the planet's looming annihilation, and yet unlike the typical sightless prophet of doom, you are gifted with VISION TWOFOLD.
<br />

<br />
For now.
<br />

<br />
You have developed a new game, adapted via CODE PARSED FROM THE RUNES AND GLYPHS IN AN ANCIENT UNDERGROUND TEMPLE. You believe this game to be THE SALVATION OF YOUR RACE, though you are not sure how yet. To ensure success, you will distribute the game to two teams of friends, a RED TEAM and a BLUE TEAM. You will lead the latter group. Your trolltag is <span style="color: #a1a100">twinArmageddons</span> and you <span style="color: #a1a100">tend two 2peak wiith a biit of a lii2p.</span>

You do not under any circumstance eat the MIND HONEY. The consequences are highly unpleasant.

You cultivate this honey for your lusus. It helps him not be such a complete idiot all the time. Merely most of the time instead.<br><br><br>

You are always up to your nook in the newest and hottest games. It is hard to walk around the place without squishing them. Whenever that happens you are screwed, and you have to grow a new one from scratch. Or just pirate it you guess.

Well, ok, it is.

 <b> 06/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003987">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are highly startled by the totally unexpected explosion.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003988">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Karkat and his friends and everyone they would ever meet thereafter would experience great misfortune on account of the curse unwittingly implemented through Sollux's esoteric MOBIUS DOUBLE REACHAROUND VIRUS.
<br />

<br />
Every troll's lusus would soon die. All but one of their kernelsprites would be prototyped with a dead lusus, each prior to entering the Medium. Upon entry, they would each have a bittersweet reunion with the creature after the kernel hatched, triggering the sprite's metamorphosis. For the first time, the trolls would be able to have verbal conversations with their custodians, and would be guided by them along their journeys.
<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, the underlings and warring royalty would gain the benefits of the monstrous prototypings as well. Each sprite, except for one, would only be prototyped once. The players would learn quickly that while one pre-entry prototyping per player was absolutely necessary for ultimate success, additional pre-entry prototypings merely empowered their enemies unnecessarily.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003989">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The game has no explicit rule that demands something dead for prototyping. But in practice, the kernelsprite has particular attraction to the deceased or the doomed. Across every session ever played, exceptions to this pattern are extremely rare.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003990">"Sollux: Lament."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Why did you send Karkat that code? It was such a bad idea. You suppose it was a boastful gesture to get a friend to think more highly of you. But why would flaunting your superior skills accomplish this? It was foolish.
<br />

<br />
You ought to wipe all these clever viruses you wrote off your computer. They can only bring more trouble.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003991">"Sollux: Delete."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
While deleting your virus folders, you pause on one oddball file you have lying around.
<br />

<br />
You did not write this virus. You copied it from an obscure server, far beyond your planet's global network. This application is running on that server perpetually.
<br />

<br />
It is an extremely simple ~ATH program. Its main loop is tied to the lifespan of the universe. When the universe dies, a mysterious subprogram will be executed. You have no way of knowing what that subprogram does. It runs on a protected part of the server. It is completely unhackable.
<br />

<br />
You delete the file, but it won't do much good. The program is already running elsewhere. Luckily, whatever harm it will do will not be done for many billions of years. And even then, what harm could a virus do after the expiration of the universe? This file always struck you as quite odd.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003992">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
But Sollux, even with his vision twofold, does not have the perceptional luxuries of our vision omnipresent.
<br />

<br />
When executed, the subprogram will summon an indestructible demon into the recently voided universe. This monstrous being with the power to travel through time is inconvenienced very little by his arrival upon THE GREAT UNDOING. He has the entire cadaver of the expired universe to pick apart at his whim. From its birth through its swelling maturity and tapering decay. In a reality he is known to have marked for predation, he will go about assembling followers through various epochs, even going as far as personally establishing the parameters for his future summoning.
<br />

<br />
Sollux couldn't know that the virus is essentially a formality. 
<br />

<br />
The demon is already here.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003993">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Sounds like your lusus is agitated about something up there. You already gave him his serving of honey today. If he thinks he can get more, well that's just greedy.
<br />

<br />
You wonder what could be bothering him?<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003994">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You keep your enormous BICYCLOPS chained to the roof of your COMMUNAL HIVE STEM. It is the only place there is room for him. Dueling with him on the roof during feeding time is a daily ordeal.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003995">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/26/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003996">"Be the other girl."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are now one of the five other girls.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/26/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003997">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/26/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003998">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/26/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=003999">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/27/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004000">"Stop being the other girl."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are now no longer the other girl, or any of the other five for that matter.
<br />

<br />
What's the name of this dude sitting in his FOUR WHEEL DEVICE?<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/27/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004001">"Enter name."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your name is TAVROS NITRAM. 
<br />

<br />
You are known to be heavily arrested by FAIRY TALES AND FANTASY STORIES. You have an acute ability to COMMUNE WITH THE MANY CREATURES OF ALTERNIA, a skill you have utilized to CAPTURE AND TRAIN a great many. They are all your friends, as well as your warriors, which you pit in battle through a variety of related CARD AND ROLE PLAYING GAMES. You used to engage in various forms of MORE EXTREME ROLEPLAYING with some of your other friends before you had an accident.
<br />

<br />
You like to engage in the noble practice of ALTERNIAN SLAM POETRY, possibly the oldest, most revered, and certainly freshest artform in your planet's rich history. You have a profound fascination with the concept of FLIGHT, and all lore surrounding the topic. You believe in FAIRIES, even though they AREN'T REAL.
<br />

<br />
Your trolltag is <span style="color: #a15000">adiosToreador</span> and you <span style="color: #a15000">uHH, sPEAK IN A SORT OF, uHH, fALTERING MANNER,</span>
<br />

<br />
What will you do?<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/27/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004002">"Tavros: Cut to the chase and play card games immediately."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You kickstart a rousing match of FIDUSPAWN, with the only friend you've got to play with in person, your loyal lusus TINKERBULL.
<br />

<br />
You take a look at the favorable hand you dealt yourself and crack a mischievous smile. With a HOST PLUSH at the ready, you quickly lob an OOGONIBOMB and catch your adversary off guard!!!<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/27/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004003">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 06/27/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004008">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />

 <b> 06/28/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004009">"Tavros: Command faithful steed."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
With a brooding whinny, Horsaroni shuffles his mighty hooves and makes short work of the fidusucker, boosting his vitals!
<br />

<br />
Horsaroni is now primed and raring for battle. Look out Tinkerbull!!!<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/28/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004010">"Tavros: Horsaroni: Spawntech -&gt; Slumberbuddies."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You use your awesome bestial communion abilities and bend the ferocious stallion to your whim. Tinkerbull can't stand the suspense!<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/28/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004011">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Nap time!
<br />

<br />
Everybody wins. Horsaroni gains a bunch of levels. In no time he will be ready to breed and you can put him out to stud.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/28/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004012">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Good game everybody. That was a lot of fun. Time to do some other stuff you guess.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/28/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004013">"Tavros: Roll up your ramp."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This is how you get up to your recuperacoon when it's time to rest. It's kind of a production getting in and out.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/28/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004014">"Tavros: Hop in."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You can't fit all the way in because of your huge horns. It makes it hard to get any solid shuteye.
<br />

<br />
Oh great, now you're covered in slime. Why did you do this? You're going to have to change your clothes. There goes another solid hour down the tubes.
<br />

<br />
Aw damn and there goes your four wheel device down the ramp. That happens a lot.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004015">"Tavros: Take lance."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
After a major cleanup rigmarole and a lot of crawling around your respiteblock, you equip your JOUSTING LANCE.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004016">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You like to practice your jousting outside. One day you hope to prove yourself worthy of recruitment into the halls of the dreaded imperial CAVALREAPERS. Assuming you are not slated for culling first on account of your disability. Or really any other arbitrary reason.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004017">"Tavros: Admire posters."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You wheel over to your favorite poster featuring PUPA PAN, which is your favorite thing. You have always fantasized that one day intrepid young Pupa would come and take you away, and together you would fly to a beautiful paradise planet of legend, that has all sorts of fanciful stuff like pirates, treasure, a cruel villain with a missing arm and a missing eye, and these weird aliens called &quot;indians&quot;. You have left your window open since you were very young, just in case Pupa stopped by one night and decided to splash a pinch of SPECIAL STARDUST in your face.
<br />

<br />
You have had this interest far prior to your accident. Being paralyzed isn't what made you want to be able to fly. That would be dumb and would make no sense.
<br />

<br />
Being paralyzed does sort of make you want to be able to walk, though.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004018">"Way in the future..."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Over the course of your long journey, at one point you were fitted with a cool pair of robolegs. The guy who likes to build robots built them for you. 
<br />

<br />
But then, he does like to break them more than he likes to build them. It's usually why he builds them in the first place. 
<br />

<br />
Occasionally though, he will allow philanthropy to override misanthrobopy.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004019">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You were lucky enough to have a friend who didn't mind getting her hands dirty on account of your best interest. 
<br />

<br />
A friend with a chainsaw.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004020">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The guy who likes to build robots just stood there and watched. It would always make everyone uncomfortable whenever he would just stand there. 
<br />

<br />
And watch.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004021">"And way back again..."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
But before that you had to scoot around in your wheel device throughout the various worlds of the Medium, and endure all sorts of follies related to your disability, which on account of their great plurality and marginal relevance we will not get to see. Just as well.
<br />

<br />
Wow, look what happens when you space out and contemplate the future like that. The messages start piling up.<br><br><br>

<br />
You both then proceed to have one of the worst rap-offs in the history of paradox space.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004024">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make your way through the burning woods to meet the lusus you never had.
<br />

<br />
It's time for her to hatch. It's now or never.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004025">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Since the world is about to end anyway, you suppose it no longer matters if the DOOMSDAY SCALE is tipped.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004026">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The counterweight is the skull of an ancient mother grub, slain thousands of solar sweeps ago.
<br />

<br />
The egg contains a rare species of dragon which remains blind until maturity, using its other senses to survive. It has balanced the skull here for millennia, waiting for the warmth of a meteor-sparked forest fire before hatching.
<br />

<br />
In case it wasn't clear, dragons are real.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004027">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
While she slept in her egg, she would communicate with you in your sleep. 
<br />

<br />
After your accident, she would use your dreams to teach you to detect the world around you without vision.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004028">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
As you learned, your dreams became more vivid. Where before there was darkness, odors and flavors painted a striking picture. You found yourself surrounded by bright honey walls, and in the sky was a huge tasty ball of cotton candy, which is this sweet troll delicacy we wouldn't know anything about.
<br />

<br />
The first time you caught a glimpse of this world in your dreams, there was no turning back.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004029">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The young lusus would take to the sky and promptly get herself killed. This would be much more shocking and maybe a little bit more sad if we didn't already know it was going to happen.
<br />

<br />
We already knew this. But of course, you didn't.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004030">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The dragon never smelled it coming.
<br />

<br />
She would fall to your treehive. On your return, she would be scooped up by a sympathetic ally and deposited into the kernelsprite. 
<br />

<br />
Then you and she could talk! There would be plenty to discuss.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004031">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The doomsday device would display the amount of time you had to get back to your hive and enter the Medium before the forest was destroyed.
<br />

<br />
At the time, it wouldn't occur to you to wonder whether the device was directly responsible for the apocalypse, or merely served as its precisely calibrated harbinger. And it certainly wouldn't occur to you to cast doubt on any perceived difference between those two things.
<br />

<br />
It wouldn't until later, when you better understood the game you were about to play.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/01/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004032">"Be the other other girl."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are now the other other girl.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/01/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004033">"Render the girl in a more symbolic manner."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
That's better. We can now be properly introduced.
<br />

<br />
Who's this spooky lady?<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/01/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004034">"Enter name."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your name is ARADIA MEGIDO. 
<br />

<br />
You once had a number of INTERESTS, which in time you have LOST INTEREST IN. You seem to recollect once having a fondness for ARCHEOLOGY, though now have trouble recalling this passion. It nonetheless has led you to find your PRESENT CALLING, which came through the discovery of these MYSTIC RUINS on which you presently stand, and which you recently DESECRATED OUT OF BOREDOM.
<br />

<br />
Guiding you to this calling were the VOICES OF THE DEAD, which you have been able to hear since you were young. The voices have become louder as THE GREAT UNDOING approaches. This trend in escalation began after an ACCIDENT involving a CERTAIN KIND OF ROLE PLAYING, which might have been another of your interests once upon a time. It doesn't matter much anymore.
<br />

<br />
The accident resulted in the DEATH OF YOUR LUSUS, which prompted you to leave your home and take up these ruins as residence. On the instruction of your ANCESTORS, you have recovered MYSTERIOUS TECHNOLOGY from the ruins, and convinced a friend to adapt it into a GAME THAT WILL BRING ABOUT THE DESTRUCTION OF YOUR CIVILIZATION. And by convinced, you suppose you mean tricked.
<br />

<br />
He has tentatively named the game SGRUB, which is a word that is NOT TERRIBLY ELEGANT. If it were marketed by a legitimate game company instead of rapidly patched together by a young hacker, it would ostensibly be given a better title. He is presently mobilizing twelve friends to play it, including him and yourself. He believes he will lead the blue team. But he is wrong.
<br />

<br />
Your trolltag is <span style="color: #a10000">apocalypseArisen</span> and there is typically a <span style="color: #a10000">pr0n0unced h0ll0wness t0 y0ur w0rds.</span>
<br />

<br />
What will you do?<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/01/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004035">"Aradia: Retrieve computer."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It's not up to you to decide what you retrieve from your sylladex. It's up to the spirits.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/01/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004036">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Looks like the spirits are being cooperative today, if a bit cryptic, as usual.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/01/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004037">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Who's this douchebag?<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/01/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004038">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You found this baffling artifact some time ago on one of your digs. The creature on its facade is completely mystifying. You have taken to using it as your primary computing device on account of its bizarre novelty, as well as convenient portability.
<br />

<br />
Oh, look who's bothering you again.
<br />

<br />
She's always bugging you. Bugging and fussing and meddling. What's her deal! You guess it's flattering that she wants to talk to you so much though. 
<br />

<br />
You're ok with it. You're ok with a lot of things.<br><br><br>

You try to be the mysterious spider girl and fail.

<br />
She's way too mysterious for you to be her yet! Seriously, what's up with those glasses? What's up with that robo-arm? What's her deal!
<br />

<br />
She guesses it's flattering that you want to be her though. She guesses she doesn't mind. It's cool.

<br />
When you would finally wake up, you'd discover all of your teammates had connected to each other and entered the Medium. You would be the last to enter. Your long nap would facilitate a series of important dreams that would prove essential in support of your teammates. 
<br />

<br />
But here and now, the destruction of your hive would be imminent unless you could quickly establish a connection to the first player of the group and complete the chain.<br><br><br>

Since that moody kid is busy flipping his bifurcated lid, we might as well take a moment to get to know this silly cat girl. 
<br />

<br />
Gosh who is she??<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/04/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004056">"Enter name."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your name is NEPETA LEIJON. 
<br />

<br />
You live in a CAVE that is also a HIVE, but still mostly just a CAVE. You like to engage in FRIENDLY ROLE PLAYING, but not the DANGEROUS KIND. Never the DANGEROUS KIND. It's TOO DANGEROUS! Too many of your good friends have gotten hurt that way.
<br />

<br />
Your daily routine is dangerous enough as it is. You prowl the wilderness for GREAT BEASTS, and stalk them and take them down with nothing but your SHARP CLAWS AND TEETH! You take them back to your cave and EAT THEM, and from time to time, WEAR THEIR PELTS FOR FUN. You like to paint WALL COMICS using blood and soot and ash, depicting EXCITING TALES FROM THE HUNT! And other goofy stories about you and your numerous pals. Your best pal of all is A LITTLE BOSSY, and people wonder why you even bother with him. But someone has to keep him pacified. If not you, then who? Everyone has an important job to do.
<br />

<br />
Your trolltag is <span style="color: #416600">arsenicCatnip</span> and <span style="color: #416600">:33 &lt; *your sp33ch precedes itself with the face of your lusus who is pawssibly the cutest and purrhaps the bestest kitty you have ever s33n!*</span>
<br />

<br />
What will you do?<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/04/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004057">"Nepeta: Retrieve claws from arms."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are always wearing your CLAW GLOVES. You never know when you might encounter some unsuspecting prey. Or when some prey might encounter an unsuspecting you!
<br />

<br />
On Alternia, everything is considered unsuspecting prey by everything else.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/04/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004058">"Nepeta: Scratch lusus behind ears."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
She sure enjoys a good scratch! POUNCE DE LEON is the best kitty cat. You and she go on adventures together in search of the FOUNTAIN OF CUTE. You ride your sure-pawed mount into the rugged frontier. And sometimes she rides you when she gets tired, which is frequently.
<br />

<br />
It sure will be sad when she dies. But who knows when or how that will happen. We might not even really have the time to find out!<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/04/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004059">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

Later there was a cave-in.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/04/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004060">"Nepeta: Examine computer."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You saunter over to your DRAWING TABLET COMPUTER. You use this to draw... on a computer!!! It would be cool if this could somehow be adapted to serve as a fetch modus as well. That would be so much more fun than the frustrating one you're using now.
<br />

<br />
You wonder what this grumpy fellow wants? Probably something to do with that game. That seems to be all ANYBODY'S talking about lately!<br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; no! i dont care, they are fun</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; and i dont know anything about classes or bases or blood color, it doesn't matter!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; what does gr33n blood even mean! it doesnt mean anything to me and it shouldnt mean anything to anyone else!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; Well, green b100d is ok, but it's not great</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; But that's why you're lucky to have me to 100k out for you</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; Because you don't know better, and you can't fight the role the mother had in store for you</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; look at that silly little bow and arrow you always type!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; its always there, you never furget</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; why would you do that if it wasnt a playful fun thing, i am so on to you!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; My bow and arrow are highly dignified symbols</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; lol! bs!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; Archery is among the highest and most e%ceptional crafts, held in tremendous regard by the most a100f classes for centuries</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; you suck at archery</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; No</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; like actually got one to leave the bow??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; I think</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; We need to stop talking about archery</span>

<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; We will stop talking about archery</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; The topic is making me</span>

<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; no one else can stand you!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; You e%terminate beautiful, innocent creatures by the hundreds</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; I can't condone such wretched behavior</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; Beasts are meant to be 100ked upon with adoration</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; but</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; i eat them!</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; I guess that's basically acceptable in principle, but I still find it a bit unsavory</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; well i think YOUR habits are unsavory!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; No they're not</span>

<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; You're wrong about me, Nepeta</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; I do like to play games</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; But they must be e%tremely important games with very high stakes</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; Not the kind played by trans100cent green wigglers who let 100se an e%cremental surge hard in their wiggler-bottom diaperstubs</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; As it happens I have arranged to play just such a game tonight</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; Aradia and I have a private engagement to be co-leaders of the b100 team</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; *well just by purrchance it happens that ac has a private and sneaky engagement to play this game as well!*</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; *and by a purrsnickety twist of fate, she will be on the R33D TEAM, with her other great friends who like to play their childish diaperpoop games!!!!*</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; That's nonsense, you're nowhere even remotely within my pro%imity that would be necessary to e%ecute such a maneuver</span>
<br />

You fondly recall your days of far more intensive role playing. It seems like so long ago now. Aside from a few unfortunate moments, it was a lot of fun. If you had to do it all over again, you suppose you would select better company. Maybe this game you are playing tonight will rekindle some of that excitement.<br><br><br>

You stand in your room on a healthy pair of legs and in a plucky little outfit. You are a low level BOY-SKYLARK, and you wield an inexpensive DAGGERLANCE, which is the closest thing to a jousting lance you can wield that is still compatible with your favorite class.
<br />

<br />
You are about to play a popular game called FLARP, which unlike most games published by major developers, was given a graceful and aesthetically pleasing name. It's a title under the EXTREME ROLE PLAYING genre, and playing it without caution can have serious real world consequences! But that's what makes it fun.
<br />

<br />
When you activate Flarp's grub, the campaign programmed for tonight will begin. TEAM CHARGE will duel TEAM SCOURGE as usual. This is going to be great.<br><br><br>

<br />
Your campaign's GAMING FLAPSTRACTIONS hatch out of their eggs. These comprise all the data and procedures you will need for your adventure tonight.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/06/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004070">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
They disperse throughout the terrain surrounding your hive. They follow both preprogrammed and live instructions by your CLOUDER, a member of Team Scourge, whose role is to provide you with a challenging scenario, while your teammate does the same for Scourge's other player.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/06/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004071">"Tavros: Go outside and begin adventure."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You take your starting position in the field. The game is afoot, and anything can happen now. It's up to you to consult your maps and work with your teammate to discover the objective of the quest, find treasure, and slay monsters.
<br />

<br />
Your STAT BAT has bonded with you. This keeps track of every attribute for your character, including vitals. While these attributes in principle remain abstractions, due to the fact that this is EXTREME role playing, they will always relate in some way to your real life attributes as well. You've got to be careful out here!<br><br><br>

Anyone.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/07/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004080">"HURRY"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You switch to a vague teaser of the final unseen troll in the nick of time.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/07/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004081">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/08/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004083">"Aradia: Go home."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You head back to your hive to get the blue team's session started. 
<br />

<br />
It's been a while.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/08/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004084">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You revisit the remains of your quaint rural hive. Your lawnring and the small excavation sites you dug up for practice are all overgrown with vegetation.
<br />

<br />
You haven't been here since the night of the accident. On that night you found your CALLING. The voices of the dead grew louder, urging you to return to the ruins you discovered not long before. You left so abruptly, you didn't even have time to bury your lusus.
<br />

<br />
But that's fine, because trolls don't typically bury their dead. Leaving bodies to be consumed by wild animals is more customary.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/08/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004085">"Aradia: Begin session."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You have an arrangement to begin the session as co-leader with one of the blue bloods. You understand this player intends to make a power grab, and take sole possession of the leadership role. Such subterfuge is typical of their caste. But you're perfectly ok with this. It's one of the many things you're ok with. 
<br />

<br />
You allow your co-player to take the lead and enter the Medium first. You understand that the leadership role is essentially meaningless, aside from offering the distinction of being the first player to enter. You also understand that entering the game second was always your intention.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/08/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004086">"Aradia: Connect to server player."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You have a server player connect to you, someone you personally selected for the role. The devices required for entry are deployed. 
<br />

<br />
The kernelsprite awaits prototyping. But unlike all eleven other players, your dead lusus is not available. You have to use something else.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/08/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004087">"Aradia: Tier 1 prototype."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Prototyping with the frog head before entering the Medium would prove to be critical for later success. Just another of many assurances whispered by the dead. You've long since stopped questioning them, or doubting the future significance of even spontaneous acts of frivolous desecration.
<br />

<br />
Compelling your nonplussed server player to perform this task might have proven difficult. Luckily your telekinesis, an ability greatly magnified through your CALLING, would be sufficient to move the massive object, whereas the game cursor likely would not.
<br />

<br />
Your server player simply watched in mystification.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/08/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004088">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
She really just had no idea what the hell was going on.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/08/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004089">"Aradia: Enter."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You enter the Medium, taking your place in the LAND OF QUARTZ AND MELODY as the MAID OF TIME. 
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile, your client player has been exploring another world. The blue blood has a present for you. The present cannot be duplicated via alchemy at this stage of the game. It would cost too much grist, a detail which this player had not been aware of. The player would have to progress to the second gate of their own world, arrive through the gate above your hive, and deliver it in person.
<br />

<br />
Facilitating this delivery was one of the reasons why it was important for you to enter second.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/08/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004090">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your server player's confusion is only in part due to learning the ropes of a new game. There is a more significant reason for her befuddlement. 
<br />

<br />
While she followed your advice and went through the simple motions of game setup, at no point were you visible on her monitor. She saw your damaged hive. She saw the alchemiter and other devices she deployed. She saw the strange computing device on the floor, bearing the visage of a species she didn't recognize. She even saw a great big stone frog head fly through the air all by itself, and become the Frogsprite. 
<br />

<br />
And though she would ask why, and you would always delay the answer, the fact remained.
<br />

<br />
She couldn't see you.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/08/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004091">"Aradia: Tier 2 prototype."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
She couldn't see you up until the moment after the sprite's second prototyping. 
<br />

<br />
Because you were dead all along.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/08/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004092">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
We are all completely blown away by this stunning revelation.
<br />

<br />
Wow. Dead. Really? Like a ghost?

<br />
Your name is VRISKA SERKET.
<br />

<br />
You are a master of EXTREME ROLE PLAYING. You can't get enough of it, or really any game of high stakes and chance. You have persisted with the habit even in spite of your ACCIDENT. But then again, you don't have much choice.
<br />

<br />
Your lusus is VERY HUNGRY, ALL THE TIME. She can only be appeased by the FLESH OF YOUNG TROLLS. You cloud campaigns for teams of Flarpers, utilizing your abilities for ORCHESTRATING THE DEMISE OF THE IMPRESSSSSSSSIONA8LE. Your victories supply you with treasure, experience points, and SPIDER FOOD. 
<br />

<br />
You are something of an APOCALYPSE BUFF, which is something you can be on Alternia. You are fascinated by end of the world scenarios, and enjoy constructing DOOMSDAY DEVICES for the hell of it. You are drawn to means of DARK PROGNOSTICATION and the advantages they offer, particularly in gaming scenarios. Your abilities in this department were hobbled with the loss of your VISION EIGHTFOLD, and you have since sought alternatives through various BLACK ORACLES. You consult with these ominous globes, but routinely destroy them in frustration over the PUZZLING GUARANTEED INACCURACY of their predictions. Breaking them has developed into a habit BORDERING ON FETISHISTIC, and with each you destroy, you add to an insurmountable stockpile of TERRIBLE LUCK. You have to stop. But addiction is a powerful thing.
<br />

<br />
Your trolltag is <span style="color: #005682">arachnidsGrip</span> and your <span style="color: #005682">st8ments tend to 8e just a little 8it overdramaaaaaaaatic.</span>
<br />

<br />
What will you do?<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/10/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004096">"Vriska: Check out cool drawing on wall."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You drew your own role playing character for fun, as many Flarpers are prone to do. She is the best character, and you wish you were her. Oh wait, you are her! Your wish has been granted. Probably as a special boon for being so great at everything.
<br />

<br />
Her name is Marquise Spinneret Mindfang, scourge of land dwellers and sea dwellers alike, and worst nightmare to silly BOY-SKYLARKS everywhere. She has accumulated more treasure and gained more levels than any member of the PETTICOAT SEAGRIFT class ever. She gained all the levels. All of them.
<br />

<br />
Yeah!!!!!!!!<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/10/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004097">"Vriska: Proceed to computer."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You have a lot to do. So many irons in the fire OW!
<br />

<br />
Lousy dice. You just can't ever seem to go anywhere in your hive without stepping on an errant D4. Pointy little bastards.
<br />

<br />
It's just your bad luck, you guess. You've had such terrible luck ever since your accident. And it just keeps getting worse. As far as you're concerned, the world can't end soon enough.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/10/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004098">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
As you were saying. So many irons in the fire. Such a tangled web. It is a web full of flaming irons and mixed metaphors. 
<br />

<br />
Tonight is a big night. You have a lot of meddling to catch up on tonight. Bugging and fussing and meddling.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/10/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004099">"Vriska: Take dice."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You equip your enchanted dice set, the fabled FLUORITE OCTET. 
<br />

<br />
It consists of eight D8, plundered from a ghost ship during a particularly challenging campaign. In ancient times such weapons were employed by roving bands of GAMBLIGNANTS, deadly marauders with a passion for chance. They all died off though. Took too many crazy risks.
<br />

<br />
Rolling the dice will execute a wide range of highly unpredictable attacks. Very high rolls can be devastating to even the most powerful opponents.
<br />

<br />
Of course with the luck you've had lately, you couldn't make a good roll to save your life. Got to do something about this awful luck.
<br />

<br />
Gotta catch a br8k!!!!!!!!
<br />

<br />
When you get worked up about stuff you put 8's in places that don't really make a lot of sense phonetically.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004100">"Vriska: Begin meddling."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Time to get this show on the road. There are SO MANY people to meddle with tonight. 
<br />

<br />
After you ditch an unwelcome solicitor first, that is. Doesn't she realize how rude it is to meddle??
<br />

<br />
You'll fuss with her meddling later.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004101">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You go down the like fifty million stairs to her nest below. You wonder if any other kid on the planet has such a high maintenance lusus? You DOUBT it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004106">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You pass by one of your completed doomsday devices. You promised you'd build it for an especially powerful and influential member of the nautical aristocracy, in return for his collusion during your campaigns. Some guy you were in cahoots with! You guess none of it matter now though.
<br />

<br />
It was tough to build, and isn't perfect yet. Luckily one of your pals nearby is pretty handy with technology. He can be tapped for parts and favors frequently.
<br />

<br />
You wonder if any other kid on the planet has as many irons in the fire as you.
<br />

<br />
YOU DOUBT IT.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004107">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
See, look at this. She's fine. Fine and huge and hungry as ever.
<br />

<br />
You... guess you're relieved? Yes, of course. Whew! Why wouldn't you be. It would be devastating if anything happened to your dear sweet custodian.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004108">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004109">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004110">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You guess there's no delaying this guy's introduction anymore.
<br />

<br />
As long as we're in the neighborhood.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004111">"Enter name."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your name is EQUIUS ZAHHAK.
<br />

<br />
You love being STRONG.
<br />

<br />
You are so strong, you would surely be the class of the elite legion of RUFFIANNIHILATORS. And while such a calling would be quite honorable, you would prefer to join the ranks of the ARCHERADICATORS, perhaps the most noble echelon the imperial forces have to offer. Unfortunately, you SUCK AT ARCHERY. You have not successfully fired a SINGLE ARROW. Every time you try, you BREAK THE BOW. You are simply too strong. You have broken so many bows, it has developed into a habit BORDERING ON FETISHISTIC. You have to stop. But addiction is a powerful thing.
<br />

<br />
You have a great appreciation for THE FINE ARTS. You use your aristocratic connections to acquire PRICELESS MASTERPIECES, painted in the oldest and most respected Alternian tradition of NUDE MUSCLEBEAST PORTRAITS. These striking depictions of the EXQUISITE FAUNA native to Alternia remind you of the PUREST PHYSICAL IDEAL that must be sought by anyone who professes a LOVE OF STRENGTH. When those of lesser bloodlines turn up their uncultured noses at such stunning material, it MAKES YOU FURIOUS.
<br />

<br />
Practically everything MAKES YOU FURIOUS. You have so much rage, it can only be expressed through STAGGERING QUANTITIES OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE. You build strong and sturdy robots, set them to kill mode, and BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF THEM in caged brawls. Sometimes you LOSE TEETH. But they usually grow back.
<br />

<br />
Your trolltag is <span style="color: #000056">centaursTesticle</span> and with your bow and arrow ever at the ready, you <span style="color: #000056">D --&gt; Take e%ception to 100d language unbefitting of b100 b100ds</span>
<br />

<br />
What will you do?<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004112">"Equius: Check on lusus."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Now where did that craven excuse for a custodian go. It makes you furious when he goes missing like this. Probably off somewhere nursing his bruises. You swear, the old boy is made of glass. You are starting to get agitated.
<br />

<br />
Aurthour! Where are you???<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004113">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Oh, there he is. He was just preparing an ice cold glass of nutritious LUSUS MILK for you, with a thick foamy head on it, just the way you like it. 
<br />

<br />
You cannot hope to beat Aurthour in a butler-off. He is simply the best there is.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004114">"Equius: Thank Aurthour."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You accept the frosty beverage and give the good fellow a grateful pat, as gently as possible.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004115">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Seriously, he's like a soft summer peach.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004116">"Equius: Drink lusus milk."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Lusus milk is the secret to being STRONG.
<br />

<br />
Actually it isn't. You like to think that though. The truth is you're really strong because you're kind of a freak. You were chosen by one of the strongest lusus species on the planet. It was the only sort of custodian that could handle raising you.
<br />

<br />
Whoops there goes the glass, as usual.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004117">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And as usual, it sends you into a rage. The spilled milk quickly evaporates.
<br />

<br />
Got to do something to calm yourself  down. Let off some steam.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004118">"Equius: Equiup a bow."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You mean equip.
<br />

<br />
A little archery practice ought to cool you off. But of course the piece of shit snaps like a twig the moment you pick it up.
<br />

<br />
Actually, the feel of the brittle wood giving way under the astonishing might of your mangrit is starting to calm you down already.
<br />

<br />
You equip it to your 1/2BOWKIND SPECIBUS, which is pretty much useless.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004119">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You also keep a plain old BOWKIND SPECIBUS in the event that you are able to fire an arrow some day. Because a boy can dream, right?
<br />

<br />
But for more practical purposes, you keep a FISTKIND card on hand. You stow them all in your STRIFE PORTFOLIO.
<br />

<br />
Remember the STRIFE PORTFOLIO? It still exists. It didn't stop existing or anything.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004120">"Equius: Answer."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You proceed to have a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004062" target="_blank" class="postlink">conversation we read not all that long ago</a>. It went mostly like this.
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; Yes</span> <span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; no</span> <span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; Yes</span> <span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; no</span> <span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; Yes</span> <span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; no</span> <span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; Yes</span> <span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; no</span> <span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; Yes</span> <span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; no</span> <span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; Yes</span> <span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; no</span> <span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; Yes</span> <span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; no</span>
<br />

<br />
But when all was said and done, you are quite sure you convinced your good friend to stay on the right team. Not the team full of degenerates with swill coursing through their veins. You're starting to get worked up again.
<br />

<br />
Routine helps calm you down. Maybe you will talk to another friend. You talk to him every day for some reason. Though it's not exactly right to call him a friend, since you despise him. Your relationship with the fellow is difficult to describe.
<br />

<br />
It should be noted that in troll language, the word for friend is exactly the same as the word for enemy.<br><br><br>

<br />
You delve deeper into your hive where you store many of your robotic projects. The lair doubles as the caged arena where you battle them.
<br />

<br />
Under the tarp is the completed gift. You of course have no intention of delivering this to your neighbor as promised. You naturally will doublecross your accomplice, just as you assume she has plans to doublecross you. You assume she is assuming the same of you. Business as usual for blue bloods. 
<br />

<br />
You will deliver it to Aradia yourself to gain her favor, and then doublecross her and take your rightful position as team leader. How ironic that someone of your blood purity must work to win the favor of the lowest sort of peasant. Humiliating. Strangely titillating, even. But in the end, class order will be restored.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004125">"Equius: Remove tarp."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You reveal her sparkling new chassis. You have paid a great deal of attention to quality and detail in this model. She is perfect.
<br />

<br />
You don't know what to make of the feelings she stirs. For one like you to entertain thoughts of attraction for such genetic filth would be utter depravity.
<br />

<br />
Exquisite, delectable depravity.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004126">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Why, Aradia. It appears the red glass of your eye has caught the pink and green glint of the moons in their perigees. The sweet poetry almost makes a man forget how the grime that once filled your veins made his stomach turn. It is a good omen for illicit lovers. Could you imagine the scandal if anyone found out?? No one must ever know.
<br />

<br />
But worry not. Your heart will pump no more of that despicable red sludge. You have been given a new heart. You can be taught the ways of the class you were always meant for. No one is beyond redemption.
<br />

<br />
Be grateful, dear Aradia. For the first time in your meaningless life you have met a man with true compassion.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/14/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004127">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And just what do you think YOU'RE looking at??? Keep your cold, mechanical judgment to yourself. As if your own record is so spotless! Don't forget who made you. Oh, what's that? My, that is a smart mouth you have. That was the last straw. An example must be made of this insubordination.<br><br><br>

Of course he's right. Not much point in living with all these moaning spooks just to spite some guy you don't give a shit about.
<br />

<br />
But how to go about it? Can't control her. It can be difficult to manipulate the mind of the psychically gifted.
<br />

<br />
Let's see, who else is there. Terezi? Forget about it! What about that guy? Nah. Her? Nope. Not him either. 
<br />

<br />
How about this guy? Unfortunately, you can only control him about half the time.

 <b> 07/16/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004153">"Be the white text guy."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You try to be the white text guy, but fail to be the white text guy. No one can be the white text guy except for the white text guy.
<br />

<br />
The white text guy is known as <span style="color: #2ed73a">D</span><span style="color: white">o</span><span style="color: #2ed73a">c Scratch</span>.  
<br />

<br />
He is an officer of an indestructible demon known as  <span style="color: #2ed73a">L</span><.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/o.gif" border="0" /><span style="color: #2ed73a">rd English</span>. His job is to pave the way for the arrival of his master, who will be summoned upon the termination of the universe. He has worked at this task for many centuries, and will continue to do so until THE GREAT UNDOING.
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">Scratch</span> is Alternia's FIRST GUARDIAN. Every planet destined for intelligent life has such an entity meant to protect it, and facilitate the planet's ultimate purpose. A first guardian is typically almost as old as the planet itself, and each has a unique, circuitous origin through the knots of paradox space. They can be born into a great diversity of forms, though they all share a common, especially potent genetic sequence. The code grants them near omnipotence, and when merged with a host of great intelligence, near omniscience as well.
<br />

<br />
What will he do?
<br />

<br />
It's up to him. All we can do is stand here.
<br />

<br />
And watch.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/16/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004154">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
What's he up to now? Hard to say since we're not telling him what to do. Guardians can never be told what to do. Neither the omnipotent kind, nor the ordinary kind who raise kids in houses. It's a universal law of reality.
<br />

<br />
Looks like he's pondering over his next move in a game he is playing with some wicked troll girl down on the planet. Usually these matches are no contest, but she has been getting closer to beating him lately, and he has no idea how this is possible. 
<br />

<br />
Uncertainty, though rare, is quite a troubling sensation for the omniscient.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/16/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004155">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
What's this? It appears someone is contacting him. More bothersome uncertainty. How is it this youngster is able to relay an unsolicited message? He doesn't even have an account name.<br><br><br>

<br />
You find the kid you've been looking for. He's got a pretty sharp tongue and can't seem to keep it sheathed. He should learn up front you're no stranger to sharp objects yourself.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/28/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004199">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
He still won't shut up. He doesn't seem to care about the wound. He's just going on and on about the freakish color of his blood. He doesn't want you to look at it. Just look away, he says. 
<br />

<br />
You've got to admit. Now you're curious.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/28/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004200">"Jack: Look at knife."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 07/28/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004201">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It seems he's the only one of his kind with this mutant candy-red blood. An outcast. He thinks he was put on this planet covered in an ocean of his own blood to be taunted. Punished for something.
<br />

 <b> 07/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004206">"Karkat: Be in cahoots with Jack."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You and your like-blooded accomplice soon put OPERATION REGISURP into motion, a contingency plan which the archagent conveniently had on file and named himself. If it were drafted by a legitimate contingency firm, it would ostensibly have been given a better title.
<br />

<br />
Your whole team executes the plan along the course of its journey, employing espionage, mind control tactics, political sabotage, vicious interrogations and cold blooded assassinations. Everyone does their part and you begin to learn the true meaning of teamwork, as well as this troll disease called friendship.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004207">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
But before a single step is taken, Jack briefs you on the intelligence uncovered by one of his agents. It is an advantage over the queen you will seize upon while she has let her guard down.
<br />

<br />
With each prototyping by each player, the royalty of both sides would evolve. The queen with her RING OF ORBS TWELVEFOLD would first take on the claws and ridged carapace of your lusus. And then the wings and scales of Terezi's young dragon. And then the horns and gills and cloven hooves of Gamzee's fallen custodian. And so it would continue.
<br />

<br />
Though a queen is a vain creature, she is also sworn to her duty. She would be braced for the heavy load of augmentation ahead. She could certainly withstand the eight eyes of an arachnid. The fairy wings might at worst be frivolous, and the great bull horns could even be regarded as striking additions. For that matter, the sultry lips of a mother grub might very plausibly suit her. She perhaps would wear a brave face even behind a dignified mustache, and the centauring of her lower torso could transpire without much complaint. She would dutifully indulge a lactating udder. And when all was said and done, doubling her head count would surely be insult to elevenfold injury, but nothing she hadn't essentially endured already, all in the name of her kingdom.
<br />

<br />
But she would spare herself all of these additional debasements. Because before the rest came, there would be one corruption to her figure she could not abide. Her vanity wouldn't allow it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004208">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
She could not stand bearing the visage of the most loathsome creature known to existence. So vile is its appearance, so contemptible its purpose, all depictions of the creature let alone members of its population are permanently banned from any jurisdiction in the reach of her agents. Those of its kind go by many names, and so does the reviled patron god they herald - THE GREAT DETESTATION, KING PONDSQUATTER, SPEAKER OF THE VAST JOKE, or most commonly, BILIOUS SLICK. 
<br />

<br />
His true name is of course forbidden. And wearing his face is where she drew the line.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004209">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
She removed the ring and concealed it in the ROYAL VAULT while she was quite sure no one was looking. She then retired to her private chamber from which she would dispatch orders, no one the wiser of her disadvantage.
<br />

<br />
Or so she thought.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004210">"Red team: Execute Operation Regisurp."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The operation in time would be a total success. The BANISHED QUASIROYAL would make the future Alternian wasteland her home.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004211">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Until she was given a new purpose.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004212">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
But at the onset, you would know nothing of the queen's aversion to an amphibious likeness, or about her orbs twelvefold, or any such details. You were informed of her disadvantage, and would act accordingly. You and your red teammates would work to dethrone the queen in your session, while the blue team members would take on the entirely separate set of royal adversaries in their own session. This was to be a competition, after all.
<br />

<br />
Or so you thought.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004213">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You would begin to notice a strange pattern. The blue team's prototypings would affect the mutations of your session's underlings.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004214">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And your prototypings would affect theirs.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004215">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Though the signs pointed to two distinct sessions - two sets of mystic ruins, two opposing teams, two separate chains of connected players - this was all misleading.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004216">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You were joining a particularly unusual bifurcated session, meant from the start to receive all twelve players through two separate connection chains. A session with one Skaia about which twelve planets would circle. With one army of dark and one of light. With one pair of kings and one pair of queens. And with one cantankerous archagent and his typical disdain for authority. It wouldn't be until later in the session when the full chain was nearly closed that you would realize the truth. 
<br />

<br />
The truth was it had always been the same session all along. That your teams were not competing, but cooperating toward a common goal.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004217">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
In the more drawn out form of this adventure's narrative, figuring this out would have been a huge deal. We would have been completely blown away by this stunning revelation.
<br />

<br />
Wow. Same session all along. Really?
<br />

<br />
Huh.<br><br><br>
 <b> 07/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004218">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
But since we've decided to engage this epic in shorthand, you feel you must insist that we continue with this expository interlude.
<br />

<br />
It would turn out the arrangement of planets looked like this, rather. Bifurcated from each other, each team appearing to comprise a distinct chain in a distinct session without the luxury of the complete picture we see here.
<br />

<br />
It appeared that way until it was time to link the two chains, completing the circuit of twelve and uniting the teams.
<br />

<br />
For these final two links, Skaia had a plan, as it did with the order of every preceding link, and as it did with the paradoxical seeding of its own players on the surface of the planet it would later devastate to buy itself time. Its plan was as inescapable as all others, as inevitable as the reckoning it would ultimately face.<br><br><br>

<br />
Your name is KANAYA MARYAM.
<br />

<br />
You are one of the few of your kind who can withstand the BLISTERING ALTERNIAN SUN, and perhaps the only who enjoys the feel of its rays. As such, you are one of the few of your kind who has taken a shining to LANDSCAPING. You have cultivated a lush oasis around your hive, and in particular, you have honed your craft through the art of TOPIARY, sculpting your trees to match the PUFFY ORACLES from your dreams. You have embraced the tool of this trade, which conveniently is the weapon of choice for those who would hunt the HEINOUS BROODS OF THE UNDEAD which crawl from the sand at sunrise to feast on the light and the living. 
<br />

<br />
It would be convenient if you actually hunted them, but it is of course far too dangerous, every bit as suicidal as attempting to poach the terrible MUSCLEBEASTS who roam at night. So you indulge in your bright fascination with the grim through literature. Just before the sun goes down and you join your flora in rest, you immerse yourself in tales of RAINBOW DRINKERS and SHADOW DROPPERS and FORBIDDEN PASSION.
<br />

<br />
You are one of the few of your kind with JADE GREEN BLOOD. As such you are one of the few who could be selected and raised by a VIRGIN MOTHER GRUB, an event so rare as to elude documented precedent. She would defend you from desert threats, and though her life would be short, in time you would assure her of progeny.
<br />

<br />
You are one of the few of your kind whose affection for the aesthetic strongly overpowers instinctive regard for the utilitarian. As such, you are one of the few of your kind who has developed a zeal for FASHION and DESIGN and LIVELY COLORFUL PATTERNS. You decorate your hive with FLORA and FABRIC, as delicately or aggressively as inspiration demands. You are a SEAMSTRESS or a RAGRIPPER or a TREETRIMMER or a LUMBERJACK, whichever you care to be, and your unique hive is equipped with a great supply of advanced technology to accommodate your interests. The technology and indeed the hive itself were all recovered from the ruins nearby when you were very young. The seed of your hive was deployed on the volcanic rocks beneath the sand with the assistance of your lusus and her remarkable burrowing skills, and you have lived there happily together since.
<br />

<br />
You know the ruins and the hive and everything here that is not sand and rock originated from the world of your dreams. You also know that one day you will visit this world while you are awake. That day is today.
<br />

<br />

You can choose between your trademark jade or black. Even though a troll's lips are naturally black.
<br />

<br />
But they can always be blacker, and a lady with a true sense of style knows this.
<br />

<br />
In any case you think you'll mix things up and go with green for a while.<br><br><br>

Look at this mess. All this blood and sunlight is stirring bright feelings within. You often fantasize about being a true rainbow drinker from your literature. It would be a life of darting between the shadows, of persecution and being misunderstood. And of ROMANCE.

There is a lot to do before you enter. There will be a lot of people to talk to and help along the way. No, not meddle with or mediate. HELP, dammit! You are very helpful.
<br />

<br />
You have a lot of inside information on what you and your coplayers are about to face. You are jacked tight the fuck into this thing in so many ways we don't know what to say anymore. And it's not just cloud visions either. 
<br />

<br />
You have another source.<br><br><br>

<br />
In one dream, the clouds pointed you to the address of a server hidden in an obscure pocket of a realm unknowable to mortals. It contains a journal written by a young member of an alien species. She has documented her experiences playing the game you are about to play.
<br />

<br />
You can only assume this took place a long time ago. This race is likely ancient, preceding yours by millions of sweeps. Maybe billions! You like to try to imagine the adventures of these players. Were they successful in repopulating their race? Did they manage to protect their matriorb and hatch a new mother grub? Could they hold it together, or were they torn apart by the complex social dynamics, the matespritships and moirallegiences and auspisticisms and kismesissitudes that will surely plague your group along the way?
<br />

<br />
You have little doubt they succeeded with flying colors.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/03/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004247">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You have little doubt their victory was because of their leader, a great heroine, the TENTACLETHERAPIST. From what she recorded, it seems the group had very little knowledge of what they were getting into. And yet they appear to have been the only of their kind to have risen to the challenge in a session stacked heavily against them. You are convinced her leadership was the difference.
<br />

<br />
It would be nice to have the chance to talk to her. Alas, she's likely been dead for millennia. Only the incomplete record of a long forgotten quest remains.
<br />

<br />
On the other hand, if you were to discover her quest ended in failure, it might be somewhat disillusioning.
<br />

<br />
But that thought never crossed your mind.<br><br><br>

Everyone knows that just a pinch of SPECIAL STARDUST along with a happy thought will allow any boy to get up and walk again. Everyone knows this because it is in the classic tale, PUPA PAN. Young Pupa flies through the window of a fairy girl's respiteblock, falls on the floor, and has trouble getting up like an enormous pansy. The fairy girl then helps him walk again, and in return, he teaches her to fly, even though she probably already knows how to fly. Because she's a fairy. They fly out of her window together, and have magical adventures for many sweeps thereafter.
<br />

Pupa remains as pathetic and useless as ever. The stardust did nothing! Probably because it is just glittery powder with no magical properties whatsoever and is basically bullshit. Because in case it wasn't clear, magic isn't real, and neither are miracles.

<br />
The problem is that when the subject of troll romance is broached, our sparing human intellects instantly assume the most ingratiating posture of surrender imaginable.
<br />

<br />
But we will do our best to understand regardless.
<br />

<br />
Humans have only one form of romance. And though we consider it a complicated subject, spanning a wide range of emotions, social conventions, and implications for reproduction, it is ultimately a superficial slice of what trolls consider the full body of romantic experience. Our concept of romance, in spite of its capacity to fill our art and literature and to rule our individual destinies like little else, is still just that. A single, linear concept. A concept usually denoted by a single symbol.
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: red">&lt;3</span>
<br />

<br />
Troll romance is more complicated than that. Troll romance needs four symbols.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/10/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004293">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Their understanding of romance is divided into halves, and halved again, producing four quadrants: the FLUSHED QUADRANT, the CALIGINOUS QUADRANT, the PALE QUADRANT, and the ASHEN QUADRANT.
<br />

<br />
Each quadrant is grouped by the half they share, whether horizontally or vertically, depending on the overlapping properties one examines. The sharpest dichotomy, from an emotional perspective, is drawn between RED ROMANCE and BLACK ROMANCE.
<br />

<br />
RED ROMANCE, comprised of the flushed and pale quadrants, is a form of romance rooted in strongly positive emotions. BLACK ROMANCE, with its caliginous and ashen quadrants, is rooted in the strongly negative.
<br />

<br />
On the other hand, the vertical bifurcation has to do with the purpose of the relationship, regardless of the emotions behind it. Those quadrants which are CONCUPISCENT, the flushed and caliginous, have to do with facilitating the elaborate reproductive cycle of trolls. Those which are CONCILIATORY, the pale and ashen, would be more closely likened to platonic relationships by human standards. 
<br />

<br />
There are many parallels between human relationships and the various facets of troll romance. Humans have words to describe relationships of a negative nature, or of a platonic nature. The difference is, for humans, those relationships would never be conceptually grouped with romance. Establishing those sort of relationships for humans is not driven by the same primal forces that drive our tendency to couple romantically. But for trolls, those primal forces involve themselves in the full palette of these relationships, red or black, torrid or friendly. Trolls typically feel strongly compelled to find balance in each quadrant, and seek gratifying relationships that each describes.
<br />

<br />
The challenge is particularly tortuous for young trolls, who must reconcile the wide range of contradictory emotions associated with this matrix, while understanding the nature of their various romantic urges for the first time. 
<br />

<br />
Of course, young humans have this challenge too. But for trolls, the challenge is fourfold.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/10/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004294">"Examine flushed quadrant."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
When two individuals find themselves in the flushed quadrant together, they are said to be MATESPRITS. Matespritship is the closest parallel to the human concept of romance trolls have. It plays a role in the trolls' reproductive cycle, just as it does for humans.
<br />

<br />
This is pretty obvious! Not much more needs to be said about this. Moving right along.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/10/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004295">"Examine caliginous quadrant."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
When a pair of adversaries delve into this quadrant, they become each other's KISMESIS. As one of the concupiscent quadrants, it plays a role in procreation as well. There is no particularly good human translation for this concept. The closest would be an especially potent arch-rivalry. 
<br />

<br />
For instance, human players would never be able to adequately diagnose the relationship between the queen and her archagent. But troll players could immediately place it as a dead ringer for kismesissitude. They would think we were all pretty stupid for not getting it. And they would be right.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004296">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Trolls have a complicated reproductive cycle. It's probably best not to examine it in much detail. 
<br />

<br />
The need to seek out concupiscent partners comes with more urgency than typical reproductive instincts. When the IMPERIAL DRONE comes knocking, you had better be able to supply genetic material to each of his FILIAL PAILS. If you have nothing to offer, he will kill you without hesitation.
<br />

<br />
The genetic material - WITHOUT GOING INTO MUCH DETAIL - is a combinative genetic mix from the matesprit and kismesis pairs, respectively. The pails are all offered to the mother grub, who can only receive such precombined material. She then combines all of it into one incestuous slurry, and begins her brooding.
<br />

<br />
This doesn't mean the initial combination was for naught, however. In the slurry, more dominant genes rise to the fore, while the more recessive find less representation in the brood. Especially strong matesprit and kismesis pairings yield more dominant genetic material. The more powerful the complement or potent the rivalry, the more dominant the genes.
<br />

<br />
TROLL REPRODUCTION SURE IS WEIRD. We all take a moment to lament how pedestrian the human reproductive system is, and further lament that the phrase &quot;incestuous slurry&quot; is not a feature of common parlance in human civilization.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004297">"Examine ashen quadrant."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This quadrant involves a particular type of three-way relationship of a black romantic nature. Falling on the conciliatory side, it has no bearing on the reproductive cycle, except for indirect ramifications.
<br />

<br />
When two trolls are locked in a feud or some otherwise contentious relationship, one can intervene and become their AUSPISTICE. The auspistice mediates between the two, playing the role of a peace keeper, preventing the feud from boiling over into a fully caliginous rivalry. 
<br />

<br />
Since such lesser feuds are quite common among trolls, there is a significant need for auspisticing parties. Without them, too many ashen feuds would become caliginous, and begin to conflict with other exclusive kismesis relationships, leading to a great deal of social complexity and sore feelings (even more so than black romance usually involves). Without auspisticism, the result would be widespread black infidelity.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004298">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The relationships each quadrant describes tend to be malleable, if not volatile, especially on the concupiscent half where more torrid emotions reside. It doesn't take much to flip a switch and transmute blackrom feelings to redrom, and vice versa. 
<br />

<br />
In many cases, one party will have red feelings while the other has black. But it will often be the case that one party's feelings will swap to match the other's, since there is no quadrant which naturally accommodates such a disparity. But thereafter, it's not uncommon for the two to toggle between red and black in unison now and then. These scenarios naturally result in both red and black infidelities. 
<br />

<br />
This sort of relationship volatility is why conciliatory relationships are an important part of troll romance.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004300">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
An auspistice can stabilize particularly turbulent relationships. If the auspistice fails to mediate properly, or has no interest in the role, or perhaps has different romantic intentions him/herself altogether, then the relationship often quickly deteriorates into one of an especially hostile and torrid nature. There are many outside factors and influences tugging and pulling these relationships in different directions, and unlike humans who have very orderly, simple, straightforward romantic relationships without exception, trolls exist in a state of almost perpetual confusion and generally have no idea what the hell is going on.
<br />

<br />
Being confused by troll relationships is one thing we do have in common though.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004301">"Examine pale quadrant."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This quadrant presides over MOIRALLEGIENCE, the other conciliatory relationship. A reasonable human translation would be the concept of a soul mate, but in a more platonic sense, and with a more specific social purpose.
<br />

<br />
Trolls are a very angry and violent race. Some are more hot-tempered and dangerous than others, to the extent that if left to their own devices, they would present a serious threat to society, or even to themselves. Such trolls will have an instinctive pale attraction to a more even-tempered troll, who may become their MOIRAIL. The moirail is obliged to pacify the other, to function as the better half. The two partners in a strong pale relationship will serve to balance and complement each other's emotional profiles, and thus allow their other relationships to be more successful.
<br />

<br />
It's often ambiguous especially among young trolls whether a bond formed between an acquaintance is true moirallegence, or the usual variety of platonic involvement. Furthermore, romantic intentions of a more flushed nature can often be mistaken for paler leanings, much to the frustration of the suitor. 
<br />

<br />
But some pale pairings, as the one above, will be strikingly obvious to all who know them.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004302">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And yet others will seem to have been hatched for each other.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004303">"Wait! More troll romance exposition please."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
God you just can't get enough of this can you! That would have been a great point for a transition out of this illustrated sociological study, but ok, if you insist.
<br />

<br />
Now see, what's going on here is...
<br />

<br />
It's perfectly simple. When the full matrix of troll romance is in action, we have... uh...
<br />

<br />
Hey, why don't you figure it out! You should be an expert on all this by now anyway.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004304">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Later our troll hero would try to explain this to our human hero, attempting to convey all the nuance of troll romance through a nearly verbatim recitation of the preceding excerpts. 
<br />

<br />
He would try to describe how rich and textured the troll romantic comedies were compared to the one dimensional schlock of our human cinematic counterparts. He would barely scratch the surface of Troll Will Smith's virtuosity with the delicate lattice of troll romance, as he would assist the bumbling fudgeblooded Troll Kevin James through the interwoven minefield-briarpatch of redrom and blackrom entanglements, all the while sifting through his own prickly romantic situation and ultimately learning the true meaning of hate and pity. But would they succeed before the imperial drone came knocking with his thirsty pails at the ready??? Yes, they would.
<br />

<br />
But John didn't understand any of this because he's a moron, and he wouldn't shut up about his awful bullshit Earth movies. He would just go on and on and on about that garbage.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004305">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
But if there was one theme to be hammered through his thick skull, it would be the trolls' cultural preoccupation with romantic destiny. Yes, the romantic landscape is rife with false starts and miscues and infidelities, red and black. But every troll believes strongly that each quadrant holds one and only one true pairing for them, and it is just a matter of time before the grid is filled with auspicious matchups through the mysterious channels of TROLL SERENDIPITY.
<br />

<br />
In short, their belief is that for each quadrant there exists a pair or triad of trolls somewhere in the cosmos that were...<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004306">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
MADE FOR EACH OTHER.

 <b> 08/15/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004338">"Eridan: Examine block."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You conveniently return to your respiteblock so that we may study your variety of INTERESTS. 
<br />

This was very considerate of you.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/15/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004339">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Flowing through your veins is nearly the richest blood the hemospectrum has to offer, penultimate on the scale. As such, you are a SEA DWELLER, a sub-race of troll distinct from the commoners by mutation and habitat, a caste which rules over the entire species. 
<br />

<br />
But ruling, in your view, is not enough. You have an overpowering GENOCIDE COMPLEX, and have made it your sworn duty to KILL ALL LAND DWELLERS. You have amassed resources and deadly weaponry from around the world for this ambition through many sweeps of EXTREME ROLE PLAYING, while pursuing a working DOOMSDAY DEVICE which will bring armageddon to all those on the surface. Haven't had much luck with that, but maybe tonight's your night.
<br />

<br />
You hold a fascination for MILITARY HISTORY AND LEGENDARY CONQUERORS. You have dubiously modeled your profile and exploits after the most notorious figures and their stories, which are bristling with the GLORY OF VICTORY and the STING OF DEFEAT and POLITICAL MACHINATIONS and ROMANTIC INTRIGUE. It is an image you are careful to craft through EXAGGERATED EMOTIONAL THEATRICS, and your penchant for mass murder notwithstanding, people tend to regard you as a BIT OF A TOOL.
<br />

<br />
You also like MAGIC, even though you know it to be FAKE. Like a made up friend, the way wizards are. Made up make believe FAKEY FAKEY FAKES. It's still fun though.
<br />

<br />
Your trolltag is <span style="color: #6a006a">caligulasAquarium</span> and you <span style="color: #6a006a">speak wwith a vvery wweird and sort of wwavvy soundin accent.</span>
<br />

<br />
You hold off on doing anything for the moment on account of courtesy to fellow royalty.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/16/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004340">"Feferi: Examine block."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
On the subject of courtesy, you have also returned to your block so we can get a better look at you. Again, quite considerate.
<br />

<br />
Royalty sure is civilized!<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/16/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004341">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are also a SEA DWELLER. You have the most noble blood possible, the only of your kind known to possess it, and the only to share it with GL'BGOLYB, a deep sea monster also known as THE RIFT'S CARBUNCLE, EMISSARY TO THE HORRORTERRORS, or in more hushed tones, SPEAKER OF THE VAST GLUB.
<br />

<br />
This makes you the HEIR APPARENT for Alternian rulership, which ordinarily would place you in considerable jeopardy. HER IMPERIOUS CONDESCENSION would steer the flagship from the fleet and make an attempt on your life herself, if not for the protection of your monstrous lusus.
<br />

<br />
And if not forewarned of your race's extinction by the whispers of that lusus, you would have BIG PLANS FOR THE THRONE. All the plans. All of them.
<br />

<br />
You would redefine what it means to be CULLED in troll society. Under your rule it would mean caring for the unfit and infirm rather than exterminating them, and you have put this idea into practice by CULLING THE FAUNA OF THE DEEP. You tend to wild and beautiful AQUATIC HOOFBEASTS, grooming and feeding them daily. You capture and cage CUTTLEFISH by the thousands for their own good, and also because they are funny and colorful and you love them. They often swim through the bars of their cages, but that is fine. You run your whole palace as a sort of WILDLIFE ADOPTION FACILITY, even if the wildlife's need for care is dubious at best, and the practice really just amounts to an elaborate ROLE PLAYING SCENARIO. It's still fun though.
<br />

<br />
You would also look forward to using your reign to UNITE THE TWO RACES. You were told you would do this one day by your lusus, even if it does contradict her message of extinction. Oh well, you suppose NOT ALL PROPHECIES CAN COME TRUE.

 <b> 08/17/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004349">"Eridan: Go get a beverage."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Another emotionally exhausting conversation. Too many FEELINGS AND PROBLEMS. It couldn't be any clearer to you. You and this sea princess have splashed down hard into the moirail zone, and now you don't know which way's upward. Perhaps tonight you will reveal your true feelings toward her, and end these exaggerated emotional theatrics once and for all, one way or another.
<br />

<br />
You need a stiff drink.
<br />

<br />
But... ugh. Not this swill. You're not THAT desperate.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/17/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004350">"Eridan: Check fridge."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You pay a visit to what the common land dwellers refer to as a THERMAL HULL, instead of the more aristocratic and especially esoteric and alien sounding term, a REFRIGERATOR.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/17/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004351">"Eridan: Open it."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
A bunch of UNBELIEVABLY SHITTY WANDS tumble out.
<br />

<br />
Of course you knew these were in here. You're not even sure why you looked.<br><br><br>

<br />
Another emotionally exhausting conversation. Too many FEELINGS AND PROBLEMS. That guy. Talk about a high maintenance moirail. Perhaps tonight you will reveal your true feelings toward him, and end these exaggerated emotional theatrics one way or another.
<br />

<br />
You need a sugary drink.<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/17/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004355">"Feferi: Disarm."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You decide to unwind and take your mind off the drama for a while before starting the game. You nearly forgot this is going to be an exciting night. Everything you are about to do next is exciting. It is always exciting. You are excited.
<br />

<br />
You unequip <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/psi.gif" border="0" />DON'S ENTENTE, a golden DOUBLE CULLING FORK, a legendary weapon reserved for royalty, and generally only used for ceremonial purposes.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/17/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004356">"Eridan: Disarm."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You unequip AHAB'S CROSSHAIRS, which is YET ANOTHER legendary weapon, about as powerful as your KIND ABSTRATUS will allow.
<br />

<br />
You plundered it from a ghost ship during a particularly challenging campaign. It was the same old gamblignant's ship from which your accomplice at the time also plundered a set of extraordinarily powerful dice.
<br />

<br />
You almost feel sorry for the adversaries you will face tonight. They will likely pose neither team much challenge at all. Unless one of the links in the prototyping chain includes something especially huge and monstrous, but really, what are the odds of that happening?<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/17/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004357">"Eridan: Bother Vriska."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
On the subject of your old accomplice/rival, you guess you'll try talking to her one more time, even though you know she won't answer. You know she is bored shitless with you and your drama. You are almost starting not to care about this stupid doomsday device which probably won't even work. She probably KNOWS you know it won't work. She has probably put all the pieces together and knows it was an elaborate ruse to be in cahoots with her again. 
<br />

<br />
And she just went along with it playing you for a chump.
<br />

<br />
You are such an IDIOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/17/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004358">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Yeah, see? No answer. Bored shitless, just like you thought. She has much hotter irons in the fire than you these days.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/17/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004359">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
But it wasn't that long ago that you were the hottest iron. At the height of your prowess as seagrifts, Marquise Mindfang and Orphaner Dualscar were in alliance an unmatched terror, and in competition, unbridled tempest. Either way, spoils were typically traded and shared. No levels were left for anyone else to gain. None of the levels.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/17/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004360">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
She would have the victims of your conquest walk the plank.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/17/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004361">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
While you would reap the custodial spoils.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004362">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And while yet another partook not in revelry, but necessity.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004363">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
She had to keep her fed to keep her calm, to keep her terrible voice down.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004364">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
If she were to raise it above a whisper, trolls would begin dying. First, the lesser bloods, those more psychically susceptible. 
<br />

<br />
If she raised it to a shout, all on the planet would die. Land and sea dwellers alike.
<br />

<br />
And if she were ever to get really upset, she might release THE VAST GLUB, a psychic shockwave that would exterminate every troll in the galaxy.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/18/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004365">"======&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
In truth, it would be all too easy to solve the land dweller problem once and for all. You'd just need to lighten up on the feeding schedule for a while. Maybe you'd be a little too busy to bother with that hassle for once? Or maybe you could happen to be off your game for a spell? It happens, even to the best sometimes.
<br />

<br />
But nah. It would make her upset.
<br />

<br />
More emotions. More problems. That's all you need.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/19/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004366">"Some time later..."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The WITCH OF LIFE takes her place in the LAND OF DEW AND GLASS.<br><br><br>

<br />
The problem is that when the subject of troll romance is broached, our sparing human intellects instantly assume the most ingratiating posture of surrender imaginable.
<br />

<br />
But we will do our best to understand regardless.
<br />

<br />
Humans have only one form of romance. And though we consider it a complicated subject, spanning a wide range of emotions, social conventions, and implications for reproduction, it is ultimately a superficial slice of what trolls consider the full body of romantic experience. Our concept of romance, in spite of its capacity to fill our art and literature and to rule our individual destinies like little else, is still just that. A single, linear concept. A concept usually denoted by a single symbol.
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: red">&lt;3</span>
<br />

<br />
Troll romance is more complicated than that. Troll romance needs four symbols.
<br />

<br />
Their understanding of romance is divided into halves, and halved again, producing four quadrants: the FLUSHED QUADRANT, the CALIGINOUS QUADRANT, the PALE QUADRANT, and the ASHEN QUADRANT.
<br />

<br />
Each quadrant is grouped by the half they share, whether horizontally or vertically, depending on the overlapping properties one examines. The sharpest dichotomy, from an emotional perspective, is drawn between RED ROMANCE and BLACK ROMANCE.
<br />

<br />
RED ROMANCE, comprised of the flushed and pale quadrants, is a form of romance rooted in strongly positive emotions. BLACK ROMANCE, with its caliginous and ashen quadrants, is rooted in the strongly negative.
<br />

<br />
On the other hand, the vertical bifurcation has to do with the purpose of the relationship, regardless of the emotions behind it. Those quadrants which are CONCUPISCENT, the flushed and caliginous, have to do with facilitating the elaborate reproductive cycle of trolls. Those which are CONCILIATORY, the pale and ashen, would be more closely likened to platonic relationships by human standards.
<br />

<br />
There are many parallels between human relationships and the various facets of troll romance. Humans have words to describe relationships of a negative nature, or of a platonic nature. The difference is, for humans, those relationships would never be conceptually grouped with romance. Establishing those sort of relationships for humans is not driven by the same primal forces that drive our tendency to couple romantically. But for trolls, those primal forces involve themselves in the full palette of these relationships, red or black, torrid or friendly. Trolls typically feel strongly compelled to find balance in each quadrant, and seek gratifying relationships that each describes.
<br />

<br />
The challenge is particularly tortuous for young trolls, who must reconcile the wide range of contradictory emotions associated with this matrix, while understanding the nature of their various romantic urges for the first time.
<br />

<br />
Of course, young humans have this challenge too. But for trolls, the challenge is fourfold. 
<br />

<br />
When two individuals find themselves in the flushed quadrant together, they are said to be MATESPRITS. Matespritship is the closest parallel to the human concept of romance trolls have. It plays a role in the trolls' reproductive cycle, just as it does for humans.
<br />

<br />
This is pretty obvious! Not much more needs to be said about this. Moving right along.
<br />

<br />
When a pair of adversaries delve into this quadrant, they become each other's KISMESIS. As one of the concupiscent quadrants, it plays a role in procreation as well. There is no particularly good human translation for this concept. The closest would be an especially potent arch-rivalry.
<br />

<br />
For instance, human players would never be able to adequately diagnose the relationship between the queen and her archagent. But troll players could immediately place it as a dead ringer for kismesissitude. They would think we were all pretty stupid for not getting it. And they would be right.
<br />

<br />
Trolls have a complicated reproductive cycle. It's probably best not to examine it in much detail.
<br />

<br />
The need to seek out concupiscent partners comes with more urgency than typical reproductive instincts. When the IMPERIAL DRONE comes knocking, you had better be able to supply genetic material to each of his FILIAL PAILS. If you have nothing to offer, he will kill you without hesitation.
<br />

<br />
The genetic material - WITHOUT GOING INTO MUCH DETAIL - is a combinative genetic mix from the matesprit and kismesis pairs, respectively. The pails are all offered to the mother grub, who can only receive such precombined material. She then combines all of it into one incestuous slurry, and begins her brooding.
<br />

<br />
This doesn't mean the initial combination was for naught, however. In the slurry, more dominant genes rise to the fore, while the more recessive find less representation in the brood. Especially strong matesprit and kismesis pairings yield more dominant genetic material. The more powerful the complement or potent the rivalry, the more dominant the genes.
<br />

<br />
TROLL REPRODUCTION SURE IS WEIRD. We all take a moment to lament how pedestrian the human reproductive system is, and further lament that the phrase &quot;incestuous slurry&quot; is not a feature of common parlance in human civilization.
<br />

<br />
This quadrant involves a particular type of three-way relationship of a black romantic nature. Falling on the conciliatory side, it has no bearing on the reproductive cycle, except for indirect ramifications.
<br />

<br />
When two trolls are locked in a feud or some otherwise contentious relationship, one can intervene and become their AUSPISTICE. The auspistice mediates between the two, playing the role of a peace keeper, preventing the feud from boiling over into a fully caliginous rivalry.
<br />

<br />
Since such lesser feuds are quite common among trolls, there is a significant need for auspisticing parties. Without them, too many ashen feuds would become caliginous, and begin to conflict with other exclusive kismesis relationships, leading to a great deal of social complexity and sore feelings (even more so than black romance usually involves). Without auspisticism, the result would be widespread black infidelity.
<br />

<br />
The relationships each quadrant describes tend to be malleable, if not volatile, especially on the concupiscent half where more torrid emotions reside. It doesn't take much to flip a switch and transmute blackrom feelings to redrom, and vice versa.
<br />

<br />
In many cases, one party will have red feelings while the other has black. But it will often be the case that one party's feelings will swap to match the other's, since there is no quadrant which naturally accommodates such a disparity. But thereafter, it's not uncommon for the two to toggle between red and black in unison now and then. These scenarios naturally result in both red and black infidelities.
<br />

<br />
This sort of relationship volatility is why conciliatory relationships are an important part of troll romance. 
<br />

<br />
An auspistice can stabilize particularly turbulent relationships. If the auspistice fails to mediate properly, or has no interest in the role, or perhaps has different romantic intentions him/herself altogether, then the relationship often quickly deteriorates into one of an especially hostile and torrid nature. There are many outside factors and influences tugging and pulling these relationships in different directions, and unlike humans who have very orderly, simple, straightforward romantic relationships without exception, trolls exist in a state of almost perpetual confusion and generally have no idea what the hell is going on.
<br />

<br />
Being confused by troll relationships is one thing we do have in common though. 
<br />

<br />
This quadrant presides over MOIRALLEGIENCE, the other conciliatory relationship. A reasonable human translation would be the concept of a soul mate, but in a more platonic sense, and with a more specific social purpose.
<br />

<br />
Trolls are a very angry and violent race. Some are more hot-tempered and dangerous than others, to the extent that if left to their own devices, they would present a serious threat to society, or even to themselves. Such trolls will have an instinctive pale attraction to a more even-tempered troll, who may become their MOIRAIL. The moirail is obliged to pacify the other, to function as the better half. The two partners in a strong pale relationship will serve to balance and complement each other's emotional profiles, and thus allow their other relationships to be more successful.
<br />

<br />
It's often ambiguous especially among young trolls whether a bond formed between an acquaintance is true moirallegence, or the usual variety of platonic involvement. Furthermore, romantic intentions of a more flushed nature can often be mistaken for paler leanings, much to the frustration of the suitor.
<br />

<br />
But some pale pairings, as the one above, will be strikingly obvious to all who know them.
<br />

<br />
God you just can't get enough of this can you! That would have been a great point for a transition out of this illustrated sociological study, but ok, if you insist.
<br />

<br />
Now see, what's going on here is...
<br />

<br />
It's perfectly simple. When the full matrix of troll romance is in action, we have... uh...
<br />

<br />
Hey, why don't you figure it out! You should be an expert on all this by now anyway. 
<br />

<br />
Later our troll hero would try to explain this to our human hero, attempting to convey all the nuance of troll romance through a nearly verbatim recitation of the preceding excerpts.
<br />

<br />
He would try to describe how rich and textured the troll romantic comedies were compared to the one dimensional schlock of our human cinematic counterparts. He would barely scratch the surface of Troll Will Smith's virtuosity with the delicate lattice of troll romance, as he would assist the bumbling fudgeblooded Troll Kevin James through the interwoven minefield-briarpatch of redrom and blackrom entanglements, all the while sifting through his own prickly romantic situation and ultimately learning the true meaning of hate and pity. But would they succeed before the imperial drone came knocking with his thirsty pails at the ready??? Yes, they would.
<br />

<br />
But John didn't understand any of this because he's a moron, and he wouldn't shut up about his awful bullshit Earth movies. He would just go on and on and on about that garbage. 
<br />

<br />
But if there was one theme to be hammered through his thick skull, it would be the trolls' cultural preoccupation with romantic destiny. Yes, the romantic landscape is rife with false starts and miscues and infidelities, red and black. But every troll believes strongly that each quadrant holds one and only one true pairing for them, and it is just a matter of time before the grid is filled with auspicious matchups through the mysterious channels of TROLL SERENDIPITY.
<br />

<br />
In short, their belief is that for each quadrant there exists a pair or triad of trolls somewhere in the cosmos that were... 
<br />

<br />
MADE FOR EACH OTHER.<br><br><br>

To bring every circle closed, her partner and rival would have to be guided in tandem. The Thief and the Seer were to serve as twin lashes of the scourge cracked by a quasiroyal against her own former kingdom to settle a score. To make him pay. Scourge's black inches would rip red miles through Derse, and the bright rivers gushing from its wounds would wash her mutineers down the drains of exile. In time they would have to answer for their treason. 
<br />

<br />
Patience would be necessary. But then, she'd recently come into all the time in the universe.<br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: ALL YOU CAN REALLY DO IS GIVE THEM A HARD TIME AND TRY TO MAKE THEIR LIVES JUST A LITTLE MORE MISERABLE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A MORE NOBLE PURSUIT THAN CHANGING DESTINY FOR THE BETTER ANYWAY, FRANKLY.</span>
<br />

<span style="color: #626262">FCG: A 600 HOUR CAMPAIGN TO COMPLETE A GAME LIKE THIS IS PRETTY GOOD IF YOU ASK ME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: AND I HAVE ASKED ME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: IT TURNS OUT ME AGREES.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I CAN'T SHAKE THE FEELING SOMEONE ELSE MUST BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN IN OUR SESSION.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: ANYWAY</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: HE SAYS HE'S WORKING ON TRACING THE ORIGIN OF THIS DISASTER.</span>

<span style="color: #008141">CGA: But Then I Noticed A Conversation In Which I Was A Participant</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Which As It Turns Out Is The Conversation Taking Place Now</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: I Scanned It Briefly And Then Perused Other Memos For My Presence</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: I Found None And Returned To This One</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: But My Part Of The Conversation Was Gone</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: I Regarded This As A Prompt To Begin Typing And Record My Contributions Live</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: That Is How This Works Isnt It</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: PRETTY MUCH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: FOR A WHILE IT WAS FRUSTRATING.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: WHEN I DISCOVERED THE FEATURE I KIND OF BREEZED THROUGH ALL MY FUTURE MEMOS, NOT REALLY READING ALL OF THEM CAREFULLY OR THOROUGHLY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: THEN I LOOKED AT IT AGAIN, AND THE WHOLE BOARD WAS GONE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: BECAUSE IT WAS TIME TO MAKE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE, SO I DID.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: AND THEN I KEPT MAKING MEMOS WITH ONLY FOGGY RECOLLECTIONS OF WHAT THEY CONTAINED.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: WHILE ALL THESE OTHER CHUMPS FROM DIFFERENT TIMES KEPT GIVING ME SHIT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: INCLUDING MYSELF.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: BUT IT WAS ALL GOOD, BECAUSE AS I EVENTUALLY BECAME MY OWN FUTURE SELVES, AND GOT TO BE ON THE OTHER SIDES OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: AND COULD DO MY PAST SELVES THE SERVICE OF INFORMING THEM HOW STUPID THEY WERE BEING.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I STOPPED BOTHERING TRYING TO REMEMBER HOW ANY OF THESE MEMOS WENT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: HONESTLY THE LAST FEW WEEKS HAVE BEEN A BLUR TO ME, JUST NON STOP YELLING AT MYSELF, HAGGLING WITH PAST AND FUTURE KNUCKLEHEADS, KILLING MONSTERS AND SOLVING PUZZLES, CYCLING THROUGH ALL THE GATES AND PLANETS LIKE A HUNDRED TIMES, ZIGZAGGING DOWN TO THE BATTLEFIELD, OUT TO THE VEIL, OVER TO PROSPIT, BACK TO DERSE, AND ON AND ON AND ON LIKE THAT UNTIL WE THOUGHT WE WON.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: BUT WE DIDN'T WIN. WE LOST.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: WE LOST AS HARD AS FAT GUYS FALL.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: What Exactly Happened</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: DID YOU READ THE MEMO JUST BEFORE THIS?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: No</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: GIVE IT A READ, I'M DONE RANTING ABOUT ALL THAT FOR NOW.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Alright</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: In A Moment</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: BUT YEAH, THAT'S HOW TROLLIAN'S TIMELINE STUFF WORKS. YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: OR NOT! SINCE APPARENTLY THIS IS YOUR ONLY MEMO REPLY. YOU WERE PRETTY SHREWD IN SIDESTEPPING THIS WHOLE CLUSTERFUCK.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: It Seems Like A Logical Way To Engineer A System Wherein One Simultaneously Functions As The Reader And Author Of The Transcripts</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Its Temporally Sound Construction</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: THEN YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS SO.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: HELL YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER MAID OF TIME THAN THE ONE WE WERE STUCK WITH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: SHE'S COMPLETELY SHITHIVE MAGGOTS, DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: I Think We Are Given Roles To Challenge Us</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: That Dont Necessarily Suit Our Strengths</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: At Least I Was</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: I Have No Idea What Im Doing Here</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: SURE YOU DO.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: OR, YOU WILL. TRUST ME YOU'LL DO FINE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: SO WHAT PROMPTED YOU TO RESPOND ANYWAY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I MEAN ASIDE FROM BEING STRONGARMED BY CONVERSATIONAL PREDESTINATION.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Oh</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: At This Point Im Not Even Sure If Im Inclined To Ask Anymore</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE A CHOICE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: DO YOU REMEMBER IF THIS MEMO WAS MUCH LONGER THAN THIS?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Um</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: There Is A Good Way To Go I Think Yeah</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: THEN MIGHT AS WELL SPIT IT OUT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Its Such A Silly Question</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: RED OR BLACK?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: What</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: YOUR PROBLEM, DOES IT PERTAIN TO REDROM OR BLACKROM INTERESTS?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Thats Not What This Is About</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: COME ON. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN USING THESE MEMOS TO SIFT THROUGH THEIR ROMANTIC PROBLEMS FOR WEEKS, I AM A FUCKING VETERAN AT THIS SHIT BY NOW.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: SERIOUSLY, I DON'T MIND, IT'LL BE A WELCOME REPRIEVE FROM SHOUTING AT MYSELF.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Im Not Sure What To Say About It</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: DIDN'T YOU AT LEAST GET A SENSE OF WHAT THIS CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT WHEN YOU SKIMMED IT?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Not Really</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: If I Were Thinking About It I Probably Wouldnt Have Wanted To Anyway</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Dont You Think Its Better To Have Unrehearsed Conversations</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Even If The Subject Matter Is Awkward</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: YES I COMPLETELY AGREE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: IT'S GOOD YOU DIDN'T READ IT. WE CAN AVOID THE SORT OF VERBAL SLAPSTICK ROUTINES I'M SICK TO FUCKING DEATH OF BY NOW.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I AM SO TIRED OF PEOPLE BEING ALL COY AND TELLING ME WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO SAY BEFORE WE SAY IT, AND THEN WE WIND UP FUCKING SAYING IT ANYWAY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: AND THEN WE PROVE TO THE INVISIBLE RIDDLER THAT IS FATHER TIME BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT WHAT A BUNCH OF FUCKING IDIOTS WE ALL ARE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW OLD THAT GETS AFTER A WHILE?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: SO REALLY, TELL ME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I KNOW IT'S ON YOUR MIND, I GOT A SENSE FOR THESE THINGS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: R OR B???</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Ok</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Red Then</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: But I Guess</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Not Really Red Enough</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: HAHA, WELL ISN'T THAT ALWAYS THE CASE?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: STORY AS OLD AS TIME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: EVEN IN PLACES WHERE STRICTLY SPEAKING TIME DIDN'T EXIST UNTIL RECENTLY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: WHO'S THE TARGET OF THESE FLUSHED LEANINGS?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Its Not The Asking I Mind</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Its The Telling</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: In A Public Forum</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S READING.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: DID YOU NOTICE ANYONE ELSE JOIN IN LATER?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: No</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: It Appeared To Be Just The Two Of Us</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: SEE</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: NOBODY CARES ENOUGH TO BOTHER.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: I Dont Know Whether Thats Reassuring</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Or Just A Bit Disheartening</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: WELL I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: THEIR DISINTEREST IS MORE A REFLECTION ON ME THAN YOU.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Disinterest Is The Operative Concept Here</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: Shes Not Even Responding To My Messages Anymore</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: How About</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">CGA: If I Agree To Consult With You About It In Private</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: THIS FEELS SO INSANE TO ADMIT, BUT</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">FCG: OVER THE COURSE OF THIS ADVENTURE, AT TIMES I ACTUALLY BEGAN TO SUSPECT I WAS MY OWN KISMESIS.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Hi.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: how are you doing? i don't even remember the last time we talked.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i have been so busy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: and it looks like you have been too.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i mean, hopy shit!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: my house is HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Actually, building up your house has been one of the more trivial ways I've passed the time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Great swaths of the structure may be copied and pasted with little architectural consideration.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I've only bothered to do so while in contemplation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's relaxing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: well, it must have cost a fortune!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: We have a lot of grist.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: how much?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I don't recall any hard figures off hand.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Last I checked, more than a million units of several different types.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Torrented between the three of us.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: torrented?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Shared, through an application.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I unlocked the disc from your registry, and deployed it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I convinced your nanna to install it on your computer.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Before an imp threw it out the window, that is.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: you got her to do that? but she's an old lady! also, a ghost.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: My methods of persuasion have been improving.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: also, she is really tricky, and plays lots of pranks.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: did she try to prank you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: huh.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: did you get nanna to do that too?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: No, your consorts were utilized for that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: the salamanders??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes. They seem eager to receive simple instruction.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: they aren't very smart...</span>
<br />

<br />

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I've been curious, but too preoccupied to inquire.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: well,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i have been talking to a lot of trolls, for one thing.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yes. um...</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i don't really know her well enough to say, i guess?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: plus, i was a little distracted.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: maybe i will find out next time i go to sleep.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Fair enough.</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: now stop being so spookily mysterious and tell me what you've been doing!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Investigating, mostly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: investigating what?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Everything there is to investigate.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Information hidden in the lore of our lands, concealed in ruins and riddles.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm looking for whatever there is to discover about the game, and more importantly, whatever exceeds its boundaries.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The cloaked traces of myth beyond its scope.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: its scope?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh, rose, did you know that we are supposed to be creating a universe with this game?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i think that's pretty neat!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It is, in principle.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But it won't happen.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: so you believe the trolls then?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's not a matter of believing them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The writing is on the wall. Literally.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: it is?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: This session was never meant to bear fruit.</span>

 <b> 09/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004595">"Kanaya: Troll the Rose human."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You begin trolling the Rose human, even though you aren't really feeling this at all.
<br />

<br />
You can't seem to figure out how to get the viewport feature to work. You muddle through the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003614" target="_blank" class="postlink">FIRST CONVERSATION</a> blind.
<br />

<br />
She does not prove to be the intellectual adversary you anticipated. But this is no longer all that surprising, now knowing the true fate of her team. 
<br />

<br />
Nethertheless, you manage to find yourself vehemently fondling the short end of the antagonism stick. The FLIGHTY BROADS AND THEIR SNARKY HORSESHITOMETER ticks a few notches in her favor. Your aggravation and curiosity are simultaneously piqued. You wish you could get a look at her.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004596">"Kanaya: Open viewport."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
There she is.
<br />

<br />
How underwhelming. No horns. Skin as white as a ghost! You wonder how she manages to look in a mirror without falling asleep.
<br />

<br />
You resume your stance of alien complacency. The SNARKY HORSESHITOMETER ticks back in your favor.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004597">"Kanaya: Keep viewing."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You continue to spy on the Rose human. What's that nonsense she wrote on her walls? What did she do to her totem lathe?? Idiot.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004598">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
OH DEAR GOD.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004599">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The exhibit of depravity maxes out your side of the HORSESHITOMETER. 
<br />

<br />
You had this girl wrong all along. She is an utter buffoon.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004600">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You hope nobody caught you looking at that.
<br />

<br />
The horseshitometer swings back to her side, as she has inadvertently caused you to flush with the shame of one thousand cocoon-wetting children.
<br />

<br />
You win this round, Lalonde.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004601">"Kanaya: View the past."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You need to put some distance between yourself and that egregious display.
<br />

<br />
These look like simpler times. Probably better to mess with her earlier on the timeline rather than later.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004602">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Hmm.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004603">"Kanaya: Enter name."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Why Ms. Lalonde. It does appear you have once again fallen out of favor with the FLIGHTY BROADS AND THEIR SNARKY HORSESHITOMETER.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Your move, Therapist.</span><br><br><br>
 <b> 09/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004604">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This is boring. Where's the challenge in teasing a mentally retarded alien girl? Her stupid walkthrough was probably plagiarized from another more advanced civilization or something.
<br />

<br />
Maybe bothering her friends will be more interesting.<br><br><br>

AUGH. Stupid trolls.

Looks like this package is going to be late.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004607">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The conversations with the other two humans didn't go that well either.
<br />

<br />
Must be something about the human intellect, and a specific posture it assumes. Particularly when a certain subject is broached.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004608">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And yet...
<br />

<br />
Your curiosity. It remains piqued.
<br />

<br />
How maddening.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004609">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Earth is surprisingly pretty.
<br />

It seems very...
<br />

<br />
Bright.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004610">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Ok, you will have to admit that is a nice outfit. Humans get points for fashion too.
<br />

<br />
You begrudgingly concede a single SNARKTICK to the stylish human and her loyal snowlusus.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004611">"Kanaya: Troll Rose human again."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
In a little while, she is back in her hive.
<br />

<br />
You prepare an ambush. This time, the fashionable, hand-crafted gloves are coming OFF.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004612">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You proceed to have your <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002993" target="_blank" class="postlink">SECOND CONVERSATION</a>.
<br />

<br />
You feel pretty good about your effort. It was a measured balance of barbs and condescension. Your leader will be pleased with the report.
<br />

<br />
And yet...
<br />

<br />
It seems the John human was right. This is not the same Rose human you dealt with before. She has been toying with you all along. Oh, the curiosity. How it persists. The maddening, maddening curiosity.
<br />

<br />
Your arbitrating gauge decides on a draw. Snark reaped and sown in equal distribution.
<br />

<br />
This is far from over.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004613">"Kanaya: Explore this human emotion called friendship."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You can only assume this is a somewhat typical way for human relationships to blossom. It seems friendship for some humans is a basic aggregation of shallow and insincere hostilities. Human friendship sure is complicated.
<br />

<br />
You skip ahead to a point on her timeline when you suspect friendship may plausibly have been established already. You have your <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003838" target="_blank" class="postlink">THIRD CONVERSATION</a>. It does not go as well as you'd hoped.
<br />

<br />
Rose takes the lead.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004614">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your <span style="text-decoration: underline">FOURTH, FIFTH, AND SIXTH CONVERSATIONS</span> don't fare much better. This friendship is stalling fast. What are you doing wrong?
<br />

<br />
You are now getting your ass handed to you on a silver nutrition plateau. You are in serious need of a ploy to turn the tables in this duel of snarky one-upsmanship. 
<br />

<br />
Some advice couldn't hurt, you suppose.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004615">"Kanaya: Troll the Dave human."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You decide to <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003489" target="_blank" class="postlink">SEEK COUNSEL</a> from the Rose human's dark spectacled friend.
<br />

<br />
You believe you understand how to proceed.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004616">"Kanaya: Have seventh conversation."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You put into motion a cunning plan in your <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003492" target="_blank" class="postlink">SEVENTH CONVERSATION</a>, in which you have attached a <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/ConversationWithAVeryStupidGirl.Txt" target="_blank" class="postlink">MISSION CRITICAL TEXT DOCUMENT</a>.
<br />

<br />
Lalonde has finally been outmaneuvered. The horseshitometer is lopsided in your favor. And most delightfully of all, this fiendish ploy has ensured that all previous snarkticks against you have been rendered completely irrelevant. It turns out they were just a consequence of your future design all along.
<br />

<br />
You cannot hope to beat Kanaya Maryam in a snark-off. She is simply the best there is.
<br />

<br />
(heheheheheheh)<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/01/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004617">"Kanaya: Hop to 8=8."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You scan her timeline for the right moment to sync up both your sides of the dialogue. Ideally she will have long since discarded her train of thought.
<br />

<br />
You will finally reap the spoils of all your careful subterfuge. You will reap them good.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/01/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004618">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<span style="color: #e00707">TG: this whole operation is strung together with stable time loops</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: no timeline offshoots cause thats when daves start dying and that isnt no good for nobody</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: daves, plural?</span>
<br />

<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i guess its just when the most shit is going down so they figure thats the best time to mess with us</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yeah, that makes sense.</span>

Looks like Egbert came through. He wires you his measly BOONBUCK. It's not much, but it is immediately funneled into the pipelines of your various investment scams, and quickly begins paying dividends.

The figures are tight. You have this shit on fiduciary lockdown. The economy belongs to you.<br><br><br>

 <b> 10/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004643">"Dave: Be the troll girl."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are suddenly the troll girl.
<br />

<br />
In a different game session. 
<br />

<br />
In the past.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004644">"Terezi: Sniff Skaiaward."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You have recently retreated to the Veil to hide from a mysterious demon which appears to be bent on your destruction. Suddenly nobody understands anything.
<br />

<br />
There is not much to do but wander around the laboratory while the others squabble amongst each other and search for answers. You point your nose Skaiaward. It is a refreshing blue minty dot against the Medium's dark canvas. It is very far away from this meteor though. It is hard to pick up its scent clearly.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004645">"Terezi: Deploy smelloscope."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make use of your trusty SMELLOSCOPE, an item you crafted during your adventure. It came in handy so many times.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004646">"Terezi: Take a whiff."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your keen nose penetrates deep into the Insniffisphere I mean Incipisphere and zeroes in on the familiar honey-sweet smell of Prospit. 
<br />

<br />
Thank goodness it is still safe. It would be terrible if the demon were to...<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004647">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
OH NO!<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/11/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004648">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You take the brunt of the stellar smellsplosion like a sour apple punch to the snout!<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004649">"Terezi: Return to party."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You suppose you'd better report this to your teammates. Perhaps a memo is in order. But today, there will be little reason for rumpus in your partytown. Today is a very sad day. You are all in bigger trouble than you suspected.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004650">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Unsurprisingly, you return to a room full of commotion.
<br />

<br />
What is this guy staring at? Always with the staring. He is so weird.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004651">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And what is she doing with that chainsaw over there?? The rich scent of chocolatey blood fills the room. 
<br />

<br />
Good grief. You can't turn your back on these lunatics for a second!<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004652">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And here is your bold leader, passed out on the floor. He is sleeping like a wiggler.
<br />

<br />
You wonder what he could be dreaming about? Prospit is gone now, and he never even had the chance to wake up. Poor guy.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004653">"Terezi: Report news to partytown subscribers."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It is important to keep your loyal subscribers of the past and future informed. It is your duty as a dedicated bulletin administrator.
<br />

<br />
Still, it's hard to find the words to break this to them. The partytown has been host to nothing but bad news lately.<br><br><br>

On the instruction of yourself from three minutes in the future, you wait for something to happen.

You wonder what could possibly happen that will cause you to become your future self in three minutes and interrupt your past self's memo and tell her to wait for three minutes doing nothing but wondering what could possibly happen that will cause her to become her future self in...

<br />
The youngster receives striking new eyewear. Quite a handsome set. Perhaps it is customary for this species after emerging from the trials in the brooding caverns?
<br />

<br />
Or just MAYBE, this is some sort of coolkid you are dealing with here.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/14/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004664">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It seems the child's lusus was slain in the collision. He will grow up an orphan, just like you.
<br />

<br />
This adult alien male appears to be taking on the role of his custodian, instead of killing the boy outright. What a fascinating culture. 
<br />

<br />
The fellow retrieves the lusus carcass. This appears to be a gentleman who knows better than to let good pony meat go to waste.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/14/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004665">"Terezi: Observe coolkid."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You learn much of this young creature's civilization and its customs.
<br />

<br />
The adult's puppet assistant commences the standard feeding ritual.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/14/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004666">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The little coolkid is making a mess of his lovely new horseleather bib. It is about as adorable as it gets.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/14/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004667">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This race appears to be quite martially adept, even from early childhood. They must have proven to be very powerful Sgrub players. No wonder they managed to make so much money.
<br />

<br />
You suddenly understand everything.<br><br><br>

<br />
You cannot name him yet, no matter how inthufferable you find this coolkid to be! You will need to wait until his wriggling day, when he turns six solar sweeps.<br><br><br>
 <b> 10/14/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004671">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

You fail to randomly explode.
<br />

<br />
Of course you were just venting about all that. Why would you blow yourself up on account of that silly conversation? What rational reason could you possibly have to blow yourself up, or explode from any cause for that matter, now or at any point in the near future?

<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; It strikes me as an artifact rooted in universal lore of nobility</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; As valuable an asset as strength is</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; And as much as anyone with his wits is fond of being STRONG</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; Such weapons require finesse to operate</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; And surely in this case, to retrieve without damaging</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; Hence your no doubt frustrating restraint</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; Remember</span>

<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; Yes, and now, being learned in the ways of STRONGNESS</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; You like myself are unfortunately limited in the weaponry you may wield</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; Ironically the training which has ennobled you beyond others has made instruments of high b100d brittle in your hands</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000056">CT: D --&gt; Hence the state of your favored weapon, hobbling your specibus</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: you found that pretty fast</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: is that how you pronounce that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: yeah i guess so</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: i think its welsh</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: what are welsh things doing in this game</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: tactically yeah its a downgrade since its what i used to make caledscratch which is obviously way better</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: yeah thats what i figured</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: caledscratch cycles the sword through its own timeline to points when its broken or nonbroken or old and rusted or recently forged etc</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: and your snoop snowcone swords probably even better than that so yeah you got options</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">CC: I do not even process it as yelling anymore. More like a lot of blubbering.</span> 
<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">CC: More blubber spills out of that mouth than a gash in a poached whale.</span>

 <b> 11/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004753">"Jade: Consult reminders."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
That was not a conversation you were hoping to wake up to. You feel more agitated and disoriented than ever.
<br />

<br />
You consult your reminders to get your bearings on what to do next.
<br />

<br />
But you can't remember what they mean at all. You have a feeling these are all useless now.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004754">"Jade: Remove reminders."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You ditch the strings. All but one. 
<br />

<br />
You don't remember what it was for, but it reminds you of something nonetheless. Something you can't believe you forgot about...<br><br><br>

He was falling in your dream. You tried to save him. You hope he is ok.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004756">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You look up at your house. Your cool satellite tower bedroom is gone.
<br />

<br />
What's that thing floating there?<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004757">"Jade: Head home."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Someone has connected as your server player.

<br />
You are pretty sure you know who it is.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/12/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004758">"John: Be the someone who is Jade's server player."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are suddenly John being the someone who is Jade's server player.
<br />

<br />
Since you have made short work of a delicious home cooked meal, you decide to bear down on this game. However, aromas from the ghost oven persist. What is that... lasagna? Wow, that smells great. Focus, Egbert, focus!
<br />

<br />
Since your paradox sister is still napping, you guess it couldn't hurt to set a few things up first.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004759">"John: Deploy cruxtruder."</a></b><br><br>

This seems like the obvious place for this thing.

<br />
Be careful with that! Don't want to wake the doggy.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/13/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004761">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You suppose you could upgrade this thing right away, if Jade can spare some time to cooperate. You've got plenty of grist to spare.
<br />

<br />
There's a lot of new junk in the registry. You wonder what all this stuff is for. 
<br />

<br />
It costs a fortune. You have a lot of grist, but not nearly that much.<br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh, whoa.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok, i will do that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: hey jade, we have a lot to catch up on, but how about later?</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok, we have 10 minutes and 25 seconds.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: hmmmm i wonder what the significance of that number is</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: why would it be significant?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: numbers don't always need to have significance!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: but they usually do!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok, well the number is now less than it was, and therefore less significant.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: and by less, i mean more! you had better hurry upstairs and make your special item.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yes, youre right</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: hey, what do you think we should prototype this fussy little orb with?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: heheheh, it seems like so long ago that rose fed mine a clown.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: we were just messing around, we didn't even know what we were doing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i dont know...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: there are so many possibilities</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yeah...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: it's almost like your grandpa put all this crap here knowing we'd have to make that decision.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: hmmmmmm!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yes, it sure seems that way</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: he seems like he was an awesome guy, i would have liked to have the chance to talk to him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: well</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: maybe you will get that chance john</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yes, as a matter of fact i am sure we will both get that chance!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i once dreamt that we would</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: huh...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: wait, are you saying we will prototype him?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: like i did with nanna, to bring her ghost back to life?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: as...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: another ghost?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: sure, why not!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i guess that makes a lot of sense, actually.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: that is what i believe this game is for in part</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: you got to bring back your nanna, rose brought back her cat, i can bring back grandpa, and dave...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: dave got to bring back a dead bird because of course he is too cool to have any dead family members</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yeah, also he brought back himself from the future.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: who... wasn't dead, but was going to die maybe? i dunno.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: specifically to save my life, as well as yours, i think.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: wait, he did????</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: that is</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: soooo cooooool :O</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: it's pretty neat, i guess.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i almost completely forgot i was his server player!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i hope hes not in trouble, i should check on him</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: we probably have so much to catch up on</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i just messaged him, he is not answering.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i dont see him in his house either :(</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ehhh, he's fine, he has been doing a lot of time traveling.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i talked to him from the future, so he must be ok now to make it that far.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: oh, ok...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: jeez, i feel so out of the loop :(</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yes, that is why we need to get you in the loop!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: the loop being the game. hurry upstairs! your transporty pad thingies take you straight up, right?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yes! ok here i go</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh, wait!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: what!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what do we do about prototyping?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: we shouldn't put your grandpa in yet, unless we want lots of imps and ogres and stuff that look like your grandpa.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: augh, nooooooooooooooo</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: we could put in something really lame, to make all the monsters weaker!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: or at the very least, more ridiculous looking.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: like one of these weird pictures of blue ladies lying around.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what's the deal with those, anyway?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: oh god, dont get me started :|</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: he was a strange and silly man</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i guess we could just put nothing in and see what happens.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: hmmmmmmm, perhaps</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: is that allowed?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i don't see why not.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: maybe i will ask rose, because she suddenly understands everything for some reason.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yes, thats a good idea</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: we have ten minutes to think about it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: whoops! i mean a lot less than ten minutes!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: hurry upstairs, go go go!!!</span><br><br><br>

<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what is this thing, anyway??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: and why is it blocking your transporter?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: it is some sort of terrible creature my grandpa hunted</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: he called it the typheus minion</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i always hated it!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: typheus?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: like the web browser?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i guess so</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: it is probably a coincidence though</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: hmm, i don't know...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: if you think numbers always mean something, why wouldn't browser names?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yeah maybe.....</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i guess it would make sense for someone to name a really awful web browser after such a hideous monster</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: wow, you sure do hate that thing!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: well sorry, i just found it sort of a weird and creepy thing to grow up with!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i think it is pretty cool.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: and he is actually sort of cute to be honest, :p</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: :p!!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh, and screw you, typheus is an awesome browser!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: it is old school.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: joooohhhhhn, it is so crappy</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: typheus is the best and that's really all there is to say on the matter.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: YEAH RIGHT</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: now is obviously not the best time to have the argument about whose browser is better....</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: but really john you should upgrade to echidna, its so much nicer</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: after you upgrade your clunky old computer of course :P</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: maybe when i am in the game, i can give you one of mine!</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i will have you know, miss fancy computer dork...</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: rose, i have a question, and i am in a hurry!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: so hurry up and answer!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Did you know your planet was on fire?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: it is?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes. It makes a good light for reading, actually.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok, haha, that's a confusing thing you said, but that topic will have to wait!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: jade is minutes away from entering, and i need to decide what to do with this kernel sprite.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i really don't want to mess up and do something stupid.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i was thinking about not prototyping at all, to not give the monsters any new powers.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what do you think, rose?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i thought i'd ask since you seem to know all the mysteries.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes, I do seem to be shadowed by each mystery and its somber cortege of riddles, don't I?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: that is exactly what i was going to say.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: First of all, I should preface this conversation by saying I know exactly what you and Jade are going to do.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: um...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The more of our future I've been allowed to see, the more I'm presented with a challenge I'm not very comfortable with.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The trolls have tipped us off about what's to come without any regard for the consequences, as appears to be their nature.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But maybe that's why it's worked for them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Maybe their indiscretion mingles with the cosmic noise that is the fabric of temporal uncertainty.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: bluhhhhhh...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: rose, tick tick tick!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Sorry, John.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm just nervous about it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: About whether telling you what you definitely will or won't do will alter a predetermined outcome.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The result would be a splintered timeline, and we would all be sentenced to eventual oblivion.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm presently optimistic this has not happened yet, and this is still the alpha timeline. I'd like to keep it that way.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh, wow.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: you mean like when i died in another dimension, because terezi hornswoggled me?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes, sort of.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It isn't much fun, John.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what's not?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Living for months in an offshoot reality, waiting for the curtain to drop.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh, ok, i see.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: well, uh...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: is there anything you can tell me?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Hmm.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I guess I can permit myself to tell you this, somewhat definitively.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Failing to prototype the kernel is the absolute worst thing that you could possibly do.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Like, ever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh no!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: We would come into possession of all the disasters.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Exhaustive possession. Monopolization, in fact.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: then i guess i will not do that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: why is it so bad?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Because the battlefield will not be able to heal, and then transform.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It will not reach the stage which allows it to become ready to receive our universe.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: but...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i thought you said it wasn't going to be able to make a universe anyway?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: wasn't it barren or something?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: so why is it important?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Because if it does not reach this stage, we will not be able to recover the treasure hidden in its core.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Which is to say,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You will not be able to recover it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: When you go to sleep again.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: OHHHHHH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: why didn't you say so, of course the answer is treasure.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes. This is the treasure that will give us hope.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But only if it comes into being in the first place.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what is the treasure exactly?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: John, what is that sound?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what sound?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It seems to be a ticking noise.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: aaaahh!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yeah, i've got to go. we can chat about treasure later.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: anyway, i will sort out this prototyping silliness myself.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: thanks rose!</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: on the corner of my ghost bed!</span>
<br />

<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i guess my bed crashed?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i was dreaming.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i couldn't have been out for that long, because my dream was really short.</span>

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You weren't.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ten minutes, I'd say.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What were you dreaming about?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i was on the battlefield again.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: but i did not have time to seek the treasure!</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i did see a black guy wrapped up in my ghosty bed sheets.</span>

There is something familiar about this.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004844">"WV: Examine pumpkin."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 11/29/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004845">"WV: Examine ring."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You have not inspected your treasure in years. You have spent ages guarding it without understanding its purpose.
<br />

<br />
Its only purpose you have understood has been to remind you of things you have taken care to forget. But now...
<br />

Egad, a thief approaches!!! This pajama'd rogue surely seeks to put his mitts on your newfound glowy treasure.
<br />

<br />
He is definitely a thief. You have an eye for these types. He is either a master thief himself, or at the very least, an apprentice of one.<br><br><br>

John is busy at the moment. He is talking to his friend.<br><br><br>

That's right. It was in the atrium when you got slapped with that stupid blindfold and all hell broke loose.

<br />
Hello.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/06/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004910">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You have extraordinarily bad timing. Her guardian will not be pleased with your intrusion.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/06/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004911">"Don't I know you?"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Yes, you do.
<br />

<br />
You might want to step away from the computer.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/06/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004912">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/07/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004914">"PM: Rule."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You have no idea how to rule. What orders could there possibly be to give anyway?
<br />

<br />
All you want to do is deliver mail. You do not want to be the stupid queen. And you do not want to wear this stupid mailbox crown.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/07/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004915">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

THIS IS STUPID.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/07/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004916">"WQ: Approach queen."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your new ruler seems upset. You understand it is not easy being in a position of authority.
<br />

<br />
You politely inform her that as the queen she is under no obligation to wear a crown. It is her decision.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/07/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004917">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
She should understand that a queen is the sum of her decisions, not her fashion accessories. And no queen makes decisions alone. All wise rulers surround themselves with trusted advisors.
<br />

<br />
The new queen should understand she has friends to help her.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/07/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004918">"PM: Appoint royal advisor."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 12/07/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004922">"Jade: Go upstairs."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You return to find your beautiful atrium in ruins. And to make things worse, your alchemiter and totem lathe were destroyed as well.
<br />

<br />
On the bright side, it looks like your LUNCHTOP was undamaged.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/07/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=004923">"Jade: Retrieve lunchtop."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You have been dying to get back to your computer so you can touch base with John again. He has probably been going crazy wondering about you.
<br />

<br />
But it seems someone else is messaging you right now.<br><br><br>

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The geometry of the Furthest Ring is too complex.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Remember, its spacetime is labyrinthine.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: In fact, it's not really accurate to call it spacetime at all.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Since it is outside the domain of any created universe, where those properties have become instantiated and stabilized.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It depends.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The greater the distance you travel through it, the less reliably time flows.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And the more time you spend in it, the less reliably space behaves.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Time and space aren't as different as you might think.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i thought you werent supposed to know shit about either</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TG: seeing as youre the seer whatever that means</span>

Wait... you almost forgot, it's still April, and nowhere near the holiday season. You guess all this wintry weather tricked you into thinking it was.
<br />

<br />
But wait! Even THAT doesn't make any sense, since it never snowed on your island, and you were never able to connect it with the holiday season! Boy, are you confused.
<br />

<br />
But you always wanted a white Christmas, and dammit, that is what you are going to have, even though it's April, and even though you are giving all these presents to yourself, and even though Jesus Christ is no longer a relevant figure to celebrate on account of the annihilation of humanity!

You have put a lot of thought into this and you have some great ideas.
<br />

<br />
But first you would like to make something practical. Something to keep you warm in this chilly weather!<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005045">"Jade: Make earmuffs."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 12/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005046">"Jade: Just draw some earmuffs."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 12/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005047">"Jade: Combine earmuffs and lunchtop."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 12/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005048">"Jade: Combine Johnny 5 and lunchtop."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You figure as long as you have the LUNCHTOP card handy, you might as well try to do something with this dumb JOHNNY 5 GHOST IMAGE you accidentally made once.
<br />

<br />
You don't even know what this robot's deal is. You've never seen this stupid movie.<br><br><br>

Finally, a difficult to use hands-on computing solution that does nothing but roll around of his own accord while talking about his emotions and reading books fast!

<br />
FINALLY!!!!!!<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005050">"Jade: Combine Iron Man armor and outfit."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You decide to cut to the chase and do something that will have indisputably cool results. 
<br />

<br />
You go to one of the stairwell rooms and carefully observe the armor while you sketch it. You have secretly wondered whether your grandpa was actually Iron Man in his younger years. It would explain so many things, including why this armor is here.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005051">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make the IRON LASS SUIT!
<br />

<br />
It's quite stylish, but maybe a bit cumbersome for casual wear. Probably only good for special occasions.
<br />

<br />
If you are going to adopt a new regular outfit, you'd prefer something a little comfier and less ostentatious, and if possible, in less flagrant violation of copyright laws.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005052">"Jade: Combine one of grandpa's beauties and outfit."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You sketch one of his silly sun-bleached blue lady portraits. He would be so proud.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005053">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make the DRESS OF ECLECTICA! 
<br />

<br />
This is so much better.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005054">"Jade: Combine Rose's crystal ball and magic cue ball."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You lost your MAGIC CUE BALL in the explosion, so you will have to draw it and hope your modus knows what you're getting at.
<br />

<br />
You have been dying to see its predictions, and you think you are on to something here!<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005055">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Sadly, the modus interprets your circle as a boring and useless MAGIC 8 BALL.
<br />

<br />
Oh well, you guess you'll do it anyway.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005056">"Jade: Combine Rose's crystal ball and magic 8 ball."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make a TRANSPARENT MAGIC 8 BALL!
<br />

<br />
You can now see inside, and watch the dark water sloshing about the cavity in the globe.
<br />

<br />
The predictions seem kind of lame when you can see all the other possibilities tumbling around in there. Kind of makes the fortune feel irrelevant.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005057">"Jade: Combine crystal ball and glasses."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make the SOOTH SPECS!
<br />

<br />
Now you can see everything, albeit through a dizzying fisheye filter.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005058">"Jade: Combine sooth specs and lunchtop."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make the JUNIOR COMPU-SOOTH SPECTAGOGGLES!
<br />

<br />
You can never have too many cool computers.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005059">"Jade: Combine furry trophy, lunchtop, and shirt/shoes."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You grab one of your grandpa's softest trophies and use it to make a really stylish WARM FUZZY SQUIDDLEJACKET!
<br />

<br />
You do the exact same thing to your shoes to create a matching pair of SQUIDDLESNEAKS! 
<br />

<br />
The jacket and the shoes are ALSO computers. You will never be caught without a computer, ever.
<br />

<br />
You are suddenly feeling more fashionable than any kid in paradox space. All of the style belongs to you. The only thing left to do is make yourself deadlier.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/24/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005060">"Jade: Combine Dave's Midnight Crew poster and rifle."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make a GIRL'S BEST FRIEND!
<br />

<br />
Pew pew pew!<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005061">"Jade: Combine Charles Dutton and squiddle."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You still have this CHARLES DUTTON GHOST IMAGE you accidentally made.
<br />

<br />
You...
<br />

<br />
You are not sure what to do with this gentleman, if anything.
<br />

<br />
Oh well, when in doubt, squiddle it!<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005062">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You made a DUTTLE!
<br />

<br />
The duttle is weirding you out a little. You believe you will keep your distance from the duttle.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005063">"Jade: Sketch particle accelerator."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You put the leering duttle out of your mind and try to sketch one of the pieces of equipment from your destroyed room to the best of your recollection.
<br />

<br />
Hopefully it works, so you can try making something sweet.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005064">"Jade: Combine rifle, iron lass suit and particle accelerator"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It worked! The result is a huge kickass PROTON CANNON.
<br />

<br />
Obviously you can only wield this weapon in your IRON LASS SUIT.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005065">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Or you would, if you were able to afford the thing.
<br />

<br />
Dave turbo-torrented you a lot of grist, but you don't have THAT much.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005066">"Jade: Combine mummy and MC poster and outfit."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You made the DEAD SHUFFLE DRESS!
<br />

<br />
While wearing this outfit, you almost feel as if you were ripped straight from the animes!<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005067">"Jade: Combine green sun bedsheets and girl's best friend."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make the GREEN SUN STREETSWEEPER! Aw yeah.
<br />

<br />
Ok how about one more outfit. Outfits are the best, you think.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005068">"Jade: Combine dress of eclectica, Felt poster, and 8 ball."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make the THREE IN THE MORNING DRESS!
<br />

<br />
It is so fancy. You cannot imagine wearing it on anything other than super special occasions. Not to mention you'll freeze your ass off in this thing!<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005069">"Jade: Combine mecha, streetsweeper, and iron suit."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You still have this MECHA GHOST IMAGE you made a while ago, by accident as usual. Might as well throw a bunch of crazy shit together and see what sort of insane loot crops up.
<br />

<br />
The suspense is almost too much.
<br />

<br />
You make...
<br />

<br />
YOU MAKE...........<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005070">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
JOHNNY 5.
<br />

<br />
God dammit. 
<br />

<br />
Motherfucker thinks he's alive.
<br />

<br />
HE IS A TIN CAN, ROBOTS DON'T HAVE FEELINGS.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005071">"Jade: Combine Dutton and sooth specs."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make the DUTTON BUBBLE GOGGLES!<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005072">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You can see into eternity. 
<br />

<br />
Forever.
<br />

<br />
Ok that's enough.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/25/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005073">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
HAPPY APRIL 13TH, 2009 EVERYBODY!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/27/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005074">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
All of your computers light up at once as some douche bag starts hassling you, whoever this douche bag might be.
<br />

<br />
You will have to remember to keep most of these computers turned off.<br><br><br>

These things cost a fortune to make. They better do something awesome.
<br />

<br />
AND IT TURNS OUT THEY DO!
<br />

<br />
The sophisticated computing technology merged with the crystal ball provides a simple way to see anything going on right now in the incipisphere! How amazing is that?
<br />

<br />
As the Witch of Space, you figure it's about time you got better acquainted with the full breadth of your domain, which is to say, all physical locations.<br><br><br>

There he is. On the battlefield no less! That's a pretty cute outfit he's got on. You wonder what he did to make it?
<br />

<br />
You also wonder why he's not answering your messages. Does he even have a computer on him?? He should try to have more foresight, and carry no less than 5 computers on him at all times, like a sensible person.<br><br><br>

There she is! What is she doing on the lava planet?
<br />

<br />
She seemed awfully preoccupied when you spoke with her moments ago and she gave you the code for the crystal ball. You wonder who she could be talking to?<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005100">"Jade: View Dave."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
According to the spectagoggles, there are currently 13 Daves scattered around the incipisphere, including Davesprite. That is an absolutely preposterous amount of Daves.
<br />

<br />
You guess Davesprite is the one prototyped by his future self that John was telling you about? Dave sure is a clever guy. Might as well have a look...<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/30/10  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005101">"Jade: View Davesprite."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
oh nooooooo
<br />

<br />
It seems that Dave is no longer too cool to have any dead family members. This is so sad.
<br />

<br />
Hang on...
<br />

<br />
The Davecount suddenly dropped from 13 to 12. Maybe one of them time traveled away? You hope it doesn't mean what you think it...<br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yes</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: why dont you stop jumping around through time like a maniac and stop being like a hundred daves all the time and come to my house so we can make a plan to kill him??</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TG: but im still trapped in the chronologistics of this fuckin one man ballet</span>

<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: then ill break out and ride linear the rest of the way i think</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: besides we cant beat him</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: look what he did to bro and davesprite together</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: im at the top of my echeladder with all the fraymotifs and i stand no chance</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: johns even better than that even though he doesnt know it at the moment</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and he stands no chance either</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: only thing we can do is hold out until the scratch</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: what is the scratch?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: guess i shouldnt really say</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: since you sort of lead the way in making that plan</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: really??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: yeah well</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: suffice to say</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: if we cant beat him</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: all we can really do is exile him to a place where he cant teleport back</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: which hopefully buys us some time</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: to try to take out his power source in a crazy suicide mission</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: hmmmm...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: so was that like a hint?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: about what im supposed to do :D</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: kinda</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: well maybe im just being naive...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: but a crazy suicide mission does not sound like the ideal solution to me!</span>

But you've got to do something. You can't stand by and let that monster teleport-murder people all day, and frankly, the suicide plan Dave mentioned sounds just plain stupid. There must be a better way. Think, imagination!

You suddenly remember the idea your awkward fairy god troll proposed. Maybe you were too hard on him.

|RECAP LOG|
<br />
<span style="color: white">After Act 4, we began Act 5 Act 1, otherwise known as Hivebent. We were introduced to 12 trolls from a planet called Alternia, which resides in another universe. We followed these trolls as they played their own 12 player session of Sburb (or to them, Sgrub) to completion. A whole bunch of stuff happened along the way. In completing the game, they created a universe - our universe, home to Earth and our four heroes. But they were denied entry into the new universe due to an encounter with an indestructible demon. This demon was the four-times-prototyped Jack Noir from the kids' session, forced into the trolls' session due to a spacetime rift the kids would later cause, called a scratch. The trolls fled to the veil, discovered the existence of the kids, and began trolling them.
<br />

<br />
Then Act 5 Act 2 started.
<br />

<br />
Through a Trollian viewport, we see John moments before the scratch is initiated, wearing his god tier Heir of Breath suit, in the Land of Heat and Clockwork (LOHAC), about to put in motion a plan he, the other kids, and the trolls all helped orchestrate to cause the scratch. This is the first conversation Karkat ever has with John, and the last John has with Karkat, pre-scratch. Karkat proceeds to troll John backwards through his timeline. John knows increasingly little, while Karkat gradually begins to understand more. 
<br />

<br />
EVENTS FROM KARKAT'S PERSPECTIVE
<br />

<br />
10:25 (10 hours, 25 minutes) before some CRITICAL MOMENT, Jack arrives and destroys the gateway to the new universe. Aradia transports all the trolls to the veil to hide. Her army of doomed duplicates takes on Jack. They are all destroyed. The trolls find a computer lab in the veil, and stay there for most of the time remaining before the CRITICAL MOMENT, to occur at 00:00.
<br />

<br />
06:12 before CRITICAL MOMENT, Jack destroys Prospit. Shortly before this, Kanaya chainsawed off Tavros's legs to replace them with robotic legs supplied by Equius. At the sight of this, Karkat faints, and for the first time, his dream self wakes up on Prospit. He is awake for only a moment before he sees Jack, and finally recognizes him as Jack Noir, rather than the heretofore unidentified demon. Jack then kills him and all the other Prospit dreamers in the process of destroying the planet.
<br />

<br />
Karkat remains asleep for an hour, until 05:12:30 before CRITICAL MOMENT, exactly half way through countdown. While sleeping post-dream death, he dreams of horrorterrors in the Furthest Ring, an experience anyone will have if sleeping after dream death. On waking up, he orders everyone not to sleep. He also wakes up to news that the humans were discovered. Neither he nor the other trolls understand the significance of the humans right away. They were discovered when Terezi was wired 413 boonbonds from Dave, on her future instruction. She urges Karkat to take a closer look at them. He dismisses them as irrelevant.
<br />

<br />
It's not until later he makes the connection between the Jack Noir in the kids' session, and the one hunting them down, recognizing them to be the same Jack, therefore placing the kids at fault for the current predicament. He then conceives of the plan to troll the humans, as a futile form of payback, and urges his team to follow suit with a compelling speech. He isolates John as the primary target of his hatred after watching him grow up. He is sure John is fated to be his kismesis, a romantic partner specific to troll culture, centered around rivalry and loathing. In his first conversation with John in the Heir suit on LOHAC, he professes these feelings clumsily. John cannot reciprocate. The awkward exchange causes Karkat to trap himself into continuing backwards on John's timeline, and the trolling continues in reverse fashion until John's first conversation with Karkat. By then, Karkat has explained many things to John along his journey, things about the game, about his role as an ectobiologist, and about their shared chief adversary, Jack Noir. In John's first conversation with Karkat, Karkat needs to get in touch with Jade. It's at this point on Karkat's timeline he has finally understood enough that he knows he must begin making plans with the kids for their mutual benefit. 
<br />

<br />
Karkat attempts to get in touch with Jade, who continues to ignore him in a particular timeframe due to his persistent previous harassment of her in years prior. He leaves a message to her months in the past, telling her she needs to get in touch with him when her robot explodes. Her robot later finally does explode when her dream self is killed in the impact of Prospit's moon on the battlefield. When she wakes up, she remembers the message, and contacts him. But she contacts him at a point in his timeline where he is not yet interested in hearing from her. He argues with her, and is interrupted by his future self in a memo, from a time where he is trying to contact her. He and his future self argue, and Jade mediates between the two and becomes angry and frustrated, and ceases the correspondence.
<br />

<br />
By this point, the biggest meteor yet is approaching quickly, and she must enter the medium to escape. She requires John's assistance. He must recover the server disc, install it, and rescue her.
<br />

<br />
EVENTS FROM JOHN'S PERSPECTIVE
<br />

<br />
John sleeps on bro's rocket board, flying along with the meteors of the reckoning. He lands back on his planet, the Land of Wind and Shade (LOWAS). His dream self had awoken after dream Jade pushed him to safety from the blast of Prospit's moon. His dream self now exists on the battlefield, awake whenever John sleeps. He wanders the battlefield with his robot bunny, who he would later name Liv Tyler. He sees his dad and Rose's mom, and runs to meet them. But he wakes up before reaching them, and his dream self disappears. The ring he was carrying falls into a ravine below, later to be recovered by WV?, before his exile to post apocalypse Earth.
<br />

<br />
Vriska was responsible for waking him up. Upon discovering John, she takes an interest in his advancement, and uses her abilities to help him progress and set up critical events along his timeline. The only effect her abilities have on humans is to wake them up or put them to sleep. In this case, she woke him up so he would be able to receive the server disc about to come out of a parcel pyxis. The disc had been deposited into the pipeline by PM some time ago. She and John continue to converse, and he befriends her, oblivious to the true nature of her schemes. She functions as his &quot;patron troll&quot;, a troll who is particularly focused on helping one of the kids, like Terezi is with Dave, and Kanaya is with Rose.
<br />

<br />
John returns to his house, and installs the server. But not before touching base with Rose, who is committed to cracking open the secrets of the game through dark magic, and Dave who is from the future, having time traveled extensively over the course of the 24 hour reckoning period. John also encounters nanna, who gives him a pendant granting him the ability to summon her. She conjures a ghost bed for him, and cooks for him with a ghost oven. He floats on his bed high above LOWAS while he connects to Jade. 
<br />

<br />
Jade, who had woken up in her bed at the foot of the hill, returns to her house to find John setting up the equipment. John deploys the alchemiter and lathe in her greenhouse, and the cruxtruder in front of her fireplace. He opens the cruxtruder and discovers there are 10 minutes and 25 seconds until impact. They discuss what to prototype with, if anything. Rose warns him of the danger of failing to prototype, which would not allow the battlefield to heal, evolve to its final form, and grow the Tumor inside, which is critical to her plan to destroy the Green Sun. 
<br />

<br />
John resolves to prototype with the blue doll, missing an arm and an eye, to deliberately disable Jack. But Vriska puts him to sleep before he can. Becquerel then prototypes himself to destroy the meteor and save Jade.
<br />

<br />
As he sleeps, John's ghost bed crashes into an oil ocean below. He loses his computer with the server disc in it, and nanna's pendant. He hops to a small island. He notices the ocean is on fire over the horizon, and the fire is approaching. He talks to Rose, who informs him Jade entered while he slept, and is safe. She tells him about a quest he'll need to go on later, to recover the Tumor from the battlefield and bring it to her. He then talks to Karkat, who is speaking to him for only the second time from Karkat's perspective. Karkat explains exactly what the kids did that made him decide to troll them. He blames Jade for prototyping Bec, creating Bec Noir who is now terrorizing the trolls' session, while blaming John for allowing it to happen. 
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile, the fire is approaching his island, and has turned green due to Bec Noir's transformation, taking place during a duel with bro and Davesprite elsewhere on LOWAS. John is contacted by Vriska, who admits to putting him in this position to challenge him, to realize his potential as the Heir of Breath. She also admits to deliberately playing a role in the creation of Bec Noir, wanting to be involved in his rise just as she also plans to be the one to kill him. She explains that regardless of her actions leading to his rise, his existence in the troll session is immutable. Due to the nature of paradox space, that outcome could not be changed with different actions. The only consequence of different actions would be an offshoot timeline, in which all participants would be doomed. 
<br />

<br />
As the fire surrounds him, she encourages him to use his abilities, and with some coaxing from WV who commands him from his station, he does the Windy Thing. The Breeze surrounds LOWAS and puts out the fire completely, and blows John to a larger landmass, just outside a village. The Breeze also clears the clouds from the sky, but they return shortly, as the spell over the planet must be broken by other means. By unlocking this ability, he reaches the top of the echeladder and becomes the Heir Transparent. Vriska then informs him the only thing left to do is reach the god tier, which is done by sleeping on his Quest Bed which is nearby. She tells him to ask the locals about it. He does, and finds the Quest Bed beyond the village. He sits in the bed but isn't tired. Vriska gives him the choice of whether he would like her to put him to sleep. He agrees. While he sleeps, Jack Noir finds him and stabs him through the chest, killing him.
<br />

<br />
WV watches his death on the monitor and commands him to rise up. WV sees nothing except fireflies gather around John's body, while the Quest Bed glows. After the spectacle, there is no change. John's body remains motionless, and the monitor shuts off. WV believes John has died. And he is right.
<br />

<br />
But on the battlefield, his dream self appears lying on a corresponding Quest Bed. His dream self slowly takes on the signs of the wound inflicted on his real self, as it rises. His dream self then takes over as his real self, with all wounds healed, as the fully realized Heir of Breath. WV?, pre-exile, watches this happen on the battlefield. He remembers this moment long after his exile, without understanding what transpired. But on Earth, WV believes he has just witnessed the end of John's quest. WV is still in possession of the ring, and has accidentally locked himself in the station, and there is not enough power to unlock it. The only source of power is a lump of uranium which he ate hours ago. So he waits.
<br />

<br />
John now wanders the battlefield, poised to complete the objective he was given by Rose.
<br />

<br />
EVENTS FROM ROSE'S PERSPECTIVE
<br />

<br />
Rose uses her dark magic to search for ways to subvert the usual course of the game and overcome the futility of the situation, with assistance from her patron troll Kanaya, counsel from the gods of the Furthest Ring, and information provided by Doc Scratch.
<br />

<br />
Kanaya begins trolling Rose suspecting her to be the author of the GameFAQ guide she read on Alternia, a figure she grew up idolizing. But she becomes disappointed with her due to a series of miscues resulting from her sporadic, nonlinear trolling. She continues conversing with her nonlinearly, engaging in a feud of snarky one-upmanship, gradually befriending her. She eventually realizes Rose is the true author of the guide when she watches her destroy the gate above her house with magic. She then continues helping her in a more linear fashion, uncovering the secrets of the game, and sharing her own extensive knowledge of the game with her. Ultimately, as Kanaya begins to understand the true nature of Rose's plan, she becomes afraid Rose is dangerous. She is especially unnerved by the fact that soon on Rose's timeline, her viewport goes dark, and she can no longer be monitored. But she acknowledges she can do nothing to stop her. So she trains Eridan to become a powerful white wizard of hope to challenge her, as a joke.
<br />

<br />
A particular target of Rose's investigation is the Green Sun. She rips apart underground ruins to retrieve information on it, and is further informed by Doc Scratch on the subject. The Green Sun is a huge star nearly twice the mass of the universe. It resides somewhere in the Furthest Ring, and serves as the power source to all first guardians. Bec was Earth's first guardian, and when he became prototyped, Jack inherited all his powers, which are supplied by the Green Sun. Doc Scratch is the first guardian of Alternia.
<br />

<br />
Doc Scratch, like Bec, is a virtually omnipotent being, with all the same powers. Unlike Bec, he is an intelligent host to those powers, and is therefore also omniscient. His job is to pave the way for the arrival of his employer, an indestructible time traveling demon called Lord English. Lord English can only enter a universe upon its death, at which point he travels back in time to an earlier point in the universe's lifespan to assume leadership of his gang of mobsters called The Felt. His machinations, like Scratch's, are in part designed to bring about his own future entrance. Before the trolls began their session, Scratch took measures to both pave the way for English to arrive, as well as contribute to his own creation. First guardians have circuitous self-fulfilling origins, much like the players of Sburb. Bec was created in a lab through ectobiology by merging the ghost slime image of grandpa's dog Harley with Rose's MEOW code. Scratch had a similar but yet unknown origin. Scratch manipulated several members of the trolls' party into playing Sburb (Sgrub) in the first place. Notably, he manipulated Vriska into killing Aradia, who as a ghost became the primary orchestrator of the session. He was also used as something of a pawn himself, by Terezi, in exacting revenge against Vriska, causing her to lose an eye and an arm. This was another key moment in a critical cycle of revenge, leading to Terezi's blindness and awakening, Vriska's eventual death by Aradia's retaliation, and then Vriska's resurrection to the god tier as the Thief of Light.
<br />

<br />
Having done everything he needs to do, Scratch tells Rose he wishes to die. Thus the destruction of the Green Sun is to their mutual benefit, and Rose forms a plan. While she gave the short version of the plan to John, telling him he'd need to recover the Tumor, she tells the full plan to Dave. The Tumor at the center of the battlefield is in fact a very powerful bomb, capable of destroying the Green Sun. She will go to sleep, and John will bring it to her dream self. Meanwhile, Dave is to go to sleep and listen to the gods, who will tell him how to find the sun. He will make a map, and Rose will plot a course there and destroy the Green Sun in a suicide mission. Ideally, this will negate all of Jack's powers, reducing him to mortal status again.
<br />

<br />
EVENTS FROM DAVE'S PERSPECTIVE
<br />

<br />
After entering the gate above his apartment, Dave begins exploring LOHAC under the guidance of his patron troll, Terezi. Her fascination with him was prompted by the money wire from his future self, which alerted her to the existence of the humans in the first place. She watched him grow up with his bro, and made some observations about humanity through his upbringing. She then committed to helping him, in part due to her rivalry with Vriska, who sought to make sure the human she favored, John, would outpace Dave. 
<br />

<br />
Over the course of the adventures she coordinates for him, Dave experiences about 3 days chronologically due to looping through time, and fulfilling the requirements of various time loops. The key objective is to make enough money for him to be able to wire it to her in the first place, completing the time loop that started it all. The sum of money vastly exceeds what is typically gathered in a session, and it must be accumulated by manipulating the LOHAC Stock Exchange using time travel.
<br />

<br />
Along the way, Dave and Terezi befriend each other, trading comics and perpetrating financial capers. In the early going, Terezi leads him into a pot of soup prepared by his crocodile consorts, for no particular reason other than it needed to happen on his timeline. Doubtful of the need for her help, he nearly quit, but received assurance from his future self, and continued exploring. 
<br />

<br />
He goes underground and discovers gold ruins. Before entering, he's interrupted by Karkat who uses a memo to warn both him and John about their involvement with Terezi and Vriska, telling them the scourge sisters are partaking in a dangerous game of rivalry fueled flirtation which has gotten both him and John killed at least once each. Karkat speaks from a time in which he's aware of a plan developing which may lead to the kids and trolls meeting each other, and does not look forward to the results of the gathering if these trends continue. John and Dave disregard his advice. Dave proceeds into the ruins and finds a legendary sword, Caledfwlch, lodged in a block of gold. He breaks it to retrieve it, and is told by Davesprite that the sword is critical to his personal quest as the Knight of Time. Terezi then tells him he is about to fall asleep, without knowing Vriska was behind this nap as well. Dave goes to sleep, and Davesprite defends him from a horde of powerful monsters. Before Dave wakes up, Davesprite leaves to find bro. He does, and joins him in battle against Jack. When Jade enters, Jack transforms into Bec Noir and defeats both of them. Bro is slain by his own sword, and the body is discovered by Dave later, who can't bring himself to retrieve the sword.
<br />

<br />
While sleeping in the ruins, Dave's dream self wakes up again on Derse's moon. Following Rose's advice, he looks into the sky and takes off his shades. He gets his first glimpse of the gods. He then wakes up from hearing a gunshot fired by Jade as she battles an imp and quickly teleports away, the first of three times he sees her in this manner. He sees her again in the LOHACSE, and again while visiting Jade's planet.
<br />

<br />
He then goes on to make all the money needed, to buy all the fraymotifs, which are powerful battle techniques purchased from consorts, and to reach the top of his echeladder. But he still wanted to know why he would never be able to reach John's level.
<br />

<br />
To satisfy his curiosity, Terezi gives him a choice somewhere in the middle of his timeline, a choice to be decided by a coin flip. He could assign the outcome of the flip to mean he would either be shown now, or later. The outcome of the flip, which Terezi did not even look at, was a constant. Two realities are created by his two possible decisions. The decision to be shown now creates a doomed reality, wherein Dave becomes doomed. The decision to wait simply continues the alpha reality, and Dave remains the alpha Dave. Doomed Dave follows Terezi's instructions, given to him before the flip. He is to go back in time, leaving his doomed timeline, and sleep on his Quest Bed, and if he has what it takes to reach his god tier, he will. Alpha Dave, after waiting some time, was instructed to go to the bed to find sleeping Dave, and kill him, thus allowing him to face the true gravity of the decision. 
<br />

<br />
Dave doesn't go through with it, and decides to end his collaboration with Terezi for the time being. Later, doomed Dave wakes up, gets out of bed, and is immediately killed by Jack. 03:14 before the CRITICAL MOMENT, Terezi watches, and is upset by her involvement in his death. She runs off deeper into the lab.
<br />

<br />
Dave travels to Jade's planet, the Land of Frost and Frogs (LOFAF). While standing in the snow, he sees Jade appear briefly while fighting an imp, just as he did before in the ruins. He contacts her, and she mentions she has lost track of John. Dave tells her John's busy, without mentioning he was in the process of rising to the god tier. He says John can no longer be her server player, and they would have to make other plans. 
<br />

<br />
Dave tells her to deploy the intellibeam laserstation in his apartment. The device allows very complex captcha codes for certain items, like a Sburb disc, to be read which couldn't otherwise be read by the human eye. He then creates a copy of his own server disc, and uses it to connect as Jade's server player. He becomes the server player for both Rose and Jade, though past Dave would stay concerned with Rose's connection, while he, as future Dave, would concern himself with Jade's connection. He deploys a new alchemiter and helps her upgrade it. With his massive reserve of grist accumulated in his travels and his more advanced torrenting capabilities, he allows Jade to alchemize some sophisticated equipment right away.
<br />

<br />
A bit later, she contacts him again after learning of his dead bro, and dead doomed self. He assured her the dead Dave was just a doomed copy, and he would be fine. She decides Jack needs to be stopped, and they should come up with a better plan than Rose's suicide mission to stop him. He suggests the idea is futile, but lets her know she'd come to her own decision regardless, and he'd be available to talk later if needed.
<br />

<br />
EVENTS FROM JADE'S PERSPECTIVE
<br />

<br />
When Jade's dream self is killed, her robot explodes, destroying her room, causing her to fall. Bec transports her bed to break her fall. She falls asleep. Now dream dead, she has a dream in a bubble blown by a god in the Furthest Ring, and meets Feferi there. Feferi, a Derse dreamer, went to sleep to convince the gods to establish dream bubbles where they can meet while asleep, as long as their dream selves are dead. While she is asleep, 04:13 before the CRITICAL MOMENT, Jack destroys the trolls' Derse, killing her and all the Derse dreamers. She, along with all the other trolls and Jade, would then only dream in the Furthest Ring, where she met Jade and attempted to show her the gods were harmless. But Jade sees through the bubble and catches a glimpse of the gods. She wakes up with a headache, scared of what she saw, and resolves to stay awake. Feferi messages her, and introduces herself as the one from the dream. It is the second time they have spoken. The first time was long ago, from Jade's perspective.
<br />

<br />
Jade realizes her robot has exploded, causing her to remember that was her cue to message Karkat. She does, and the aforementioned confusion takes place in the memo with past and future Karkat. Past Karkat berates her, while future Karkat defends her. She reprimands both of them for arguing with each other, who are the same person separated by only 3 hours. Dave enters the memo and mocks future Karkat for his flirtation with Jade after the lecture he gave to John and Dave on the subject. Jade ends the conversation, and is in no particular hurry to get back to him about the important matter he wanted to discuss.
<br />

<br />
The meteor impact is imminent. John connects with her, and helps her prepare for entry. She makes her entry item from the pre-punched card. A tree sprouts from the alchemiter, and a green Bec-shaped pinata dangles from a branch. A green blindfold appears over her eyes, which she cannot remove. She attempts to strike the pinata with the butt of the rifle, which does no damage. Instead it releases a burst of energy, causing the greenhouse to explode, and Jade to fly out and fall. While falling, she takes a shot in the dark with her rifle. By this point, Bec has prototyped himself to become Becsprite, and has destroyed the meteor with a massive green energy blast, releasing a huge shockwave spreading over the surface of the Earth, destroying much of what hadn't been already by the meteor storm of the reckoning. Becsprite then appears in front of her bullet, and redirects it into the head of the pinata, destroying it. Jade, her house, and a large part of her island including the volcano, are all transported into the medium, on LOFAF.
<br />

<br />
She falls through the snow of LOFAF, now unblindfolded. Becsprite again breaks her fall with a bed, and again she falls asleep. She has a recollection of sitting on her bed back on Earth some time ago, working on John's present. It's then that Feferi contacts her the first time. Jade believes she is trolling her like the others, but she only means to reassure her what happened wasn't her fault, as well as inform her of her plan to establish the dream bubbles. But soon, both realize this is not a memory, but a dream they are currently sharing, with the memory as a stage. Feferi meets Jade in her room and compliments her on her work on the bunny. Feferi also claims to be dead. Jade wakes up again, just as agitated as the first time she woke up.
<br />

<br />
She gets out of bed and realizes her lunchtop is still in the destroyed greenhouse. She begins her ascent, but is interrupted by an encounter with an imp, which takes her on a trans-incipisphere journey, visiting many locations and passing by three instances of Dave, including a future Dave who ends up helping her later. The imp is finally killed by Becsprite. PM from post-apocalypse Earth, just after discovering her station and en route to the frog ruins, tries to issue commands to Jade through the terminal. Becsprite is alert to these commands, and protectively destroys PM's terminal. 
<br />

<br />
Jade returns and finds her computer undamaged. Future Dave contacts her after seeing her out in the snow. He then becomes her server player, and sets up her equipment after most of it was destroyed/transported before entry. As she prepares to alchemize new items, she is contacted by her &quot;fairy god troll&quot;, a distinction which does not necessarily have anything to do with being a kid's patron troll. Tavros seeks permission from her to commune with Bec again. The first time he did it was when she was very young, and playing with her grandpa's flintlock pistols. She accidentally fired the gun at her self. Tavros communed with Bec to get him to transport the gun and the bullet away from her, and toward her grandpa who was picnicking with the blue doll, killing him. Tavros mistook him for an intruder, but regardless, Jade is upset by the revelation. He digs himself into a deeper hole by professing flushed feelings for her awkwardly, while making bold claims of high self esteem and confidence granted from his new robot legs. Put off by this, she is not particularly receptive to his plan to commune with Becsprite to take on Jack Noir, and ends the conversation.
<br />

<br />
Vriska, who was reading the conversation, mocks Tavros for his false show of confidence. She continues to take jabs at him, calling him a coward, unable to do the one thing she asked which would have given him real confidence. She refers to the incident preceding her resurrection to the god tier. After she was nearly beaten to death by Aradia, Tavros finds her, believing her to be dead. He attempts to bring her back to life with a kiss. But having woken up on Prospit after the beating, Vriska's dream self is able to control his mind. She makes him choke himself, simply to prevent the kiss to avoid the standard resurrection process, which would prohibit god tier ascension. She does not wish to control him completely, intending to leave the following decisions to him, to make him stronger. Instead, she merely controls his hand to write messages to himself using her blood. She instructs him to take her to her Quest Cocoon, and to kill her on the sacrificial slab before she bleeds to death. He hesitates, and she continues to insist, while her dream self gradually takes on the same wounds inflicted on her real self, causing her demands to become more desperate. The more desperate she gets, the more terrified Tavros he becomes, and he finally flees without killing her. She eventually dies, and is resurrected on the battlefield as the Thief of Light.
<br />

<br />
Still holding this against him, she berates him for his newfound attitude, and regards his plan to influence the kids' timeline as a cheap imitation of her tactics. She brags about the ways she has manipulated events on their timeline so far, by practicing her abilities on Jade repeatedly, causing her to fall asleep frequently. She describes ways in which she has inserted her agenda into existing events, tipping off agents to the whereabouts of the MEOW code book, and other such incidents which contributed to the rise of Jack Noir, so she could claim responsibility for his existence, before taking him on herself. Tavros becomes angry with her incessant mockery and the extent of her treachery, and decides to seek her out to challenge her. She waits for him somewhere in the lab.
<br />

<br />
After the conversation with Tavros, Jade alchemizes a number of items. One of which is a legendary rifle, Ahab's Crosshairs, supplied by Eridan. Eridan, now believing himself to be a powerful wizard, feels he's surpassed the need for the weapon, and gives it to Jade to fuel the rivalry he mistakenly assumes she has with Rose, as payback for Rose's early dismissal of his black advances. Jade recognizes it as one of the weapons she included with the bunny for John. The weapons were provided by her penpal, who she accidentally revealed to be her grandson from the future. The pen pal swore her to secrecy on the matter, so she did the same with Eridan, though he admitted this would be the last time he talked to any human regardless. Realizing the new rifle would serve as a sort of heirloom to her grandson, she decided to discard it outside her house, and allow it to reach her grandson eventually however it may. Eridan then blew up her Johnnytop.
<br />

<br />
Another item she created was a pair of junior compu-sooth spectagoggles, allowing her to see anything in the incipisphere at the present moment. She saw John as the Heir of Breath on the battlefield, Rose on LOHAC talking to Doc Scratch, Davesprite's pendant covered in blood nearby bro's dead body, and a slain doomed Dave. She contacts Dave to make sure he's alright. She then comes up with a plan to take on Jack Noir.
<br />

<br />
She contacts Tavros again to talk about the plan he proposed, but he has left to take on Vriska. She has only one idea left. She goes up to her grandpa's lab, summons Becsprite, and tosses in her dead dream self, which her grandpa had</span><span style="color: #dddddd"> retrieved from the battlefield and stuffed many years ago. Becsprite becomes Jadesprite. But dream Jade is not pleased by the transformation. She freaks out, and releases the typical first guardian pyrotechnics. The lab</span><span style="color: #bbbbbb"> plummets, crushing the column and greenhouse below. It bounces away from the house, rolling into large snowball, and set</span><span style="color: #999999">tling near a green stump. The two Jades sit</span><span style="color: #666666"> in a state of dismay amidst the rubble of the lab, in the glow of a</span><span style="color: #444444"> damaged 4th wall. 
<br />

<br />
As the clock ticks down to the CRITICAL EVENT, the most</span><span style="color: #333333"> important character in Homestuck sits and watches this pandemonium ensue. 
<br />

<br />
And then, the second </span><span style="color: #222222">most important character in Homestuck positions a shitty drawing of himself in front of a typewriter and writes this recap.
<br />

<br />
I think this typewriter</span><span style="color: #111111"> is running out of ribbon ink.
<br />

<br />
Thank God, that white ink is such a pain in the ass to read.
<br />

<br />
Almost as much as </span>these recaps are to write.<br><br><br>

You size up the arcane contraption. The blue flicker of the coat's lining is arresting. But you don't know it's a coat. That would only invite more questions. You don't know what it shields. Nor do you know whose shoulders it was meant to cover. If you knew that - if you even knew his name - you would understand terror no human ever has.
<br />

<br />
You should really listen to Karkat and turn it off. If you start messing with it, I will seriously start fucking everything up. It would be irresponsible of both of us to let that happen.
<br />

<br />
You suddenly wonder where Jadesprite went. You wonder that because I said you did. I know where she went. But I will not say.

Not that you can hear a word I'm saying.

In your attempt to find an exit, you have pried some paneling off the walls. But you are no closer to discovering a means of escape.

So you have resolved to build a fort instead.

You feel safe and sound in the cozy confines of your wobbly station panel walls. It should allow you to relax and pass the time, while you wait for the only source of energy you are aware of to present itself.<br><br><br>

As the new queen, she will be charged with bringing the slayer to justice, and rebuilding her kingdom in a new land.

<br />

<br />
Explosives will be needed. If she were to appoint a brave ARMAMENTS REGENT for her kingdom, he could be of assistance.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/07/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005166">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, your simple message cannot seem to penetrate their thick carapaces.
<br />

<br />
Doesn't ANYBODY in this stupid desert speak blinking?<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/07/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005170">"AR: Prepare to tidy up."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You heard the new queen in town needs a powdermonkey on the double. As the kingdom's new regent, whatever that is, you spring into action.
<br />

<br />
Now this is something you can handle. Anything to take your mind off that terrible pointy head that fell on the illegal statue.
<br />

You have already viewed this moment a hundred times. It is no less confounding on your one hundred and first.

There is nothing otherwise unusual about the scene. A simple girl is understandably preoccupied by her handsome assortment of orbs, while surrounded by her ever growing band of amphibious and reptilian acolytes.<br><br><br>

<span style="color: #008141">GA: Or Bilious Slick</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Although To Be Honest That Is What We Ended Up Calling Him</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Not To Be Disrespectful Though It Was Just A Catchier Name</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: it is pretty catchy...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: if i call him that i will be sure to say i mean no offense!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Doubt Its Even Possible To Offend Him</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: thats good</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: ok then what?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: what do we do after i make this big god froggy?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: does it have something to do with the new universe we create?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Most Certainly</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: you said he was a genesis frog</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: does that mean we bring him into the universe and...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: he makes new planets or life or such?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: No</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Youre Not Really Understanding The Magnitude Of His Role</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: He Is Not Responsible For Just One Aspect Of The Universe You Create</span>

<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: really???</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Dont Mean Hes The Universe You Are From</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: We Engineered That Incarnation</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: He Is The Universe That You Are Trying To Create</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yes i got that!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Sorry</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Thought It Was Obvious But Then Wasnt Sure</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: you mean he is LITERALLY a universe?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes Literally</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: That Statement Was As Literal As You Can Possibly Make Words Be</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Know Your Species Is Frequently Insincere For A Variety Of Reasons</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: but your species is too!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: especially karkat, he is incredibly sarcastic</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Thats True But When We Do It Its Usually Just Because We Are Trying To Be Jerks</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Rather Than By Way Of A Mild Manner Perpetually Dispatching Little Puzzles Of Rhetoric Without Apparent Purpose</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: but i dont do that!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i try to say what i mean as much as i can</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yeah I Think Ive Been Discerning That</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Its A Nice Change Of Pace</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: from what?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Oh Its Not Important</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: haha, you mean from rose?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Well</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Not That It Wasnt An Enjoyable Exercise In Xenocultural Inculcation</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yeah, rose and dave are like that all the time!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: they inculcate that stuff like crazy</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: so you have been talking to her a lot i guess?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Sort Of</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: are you best friends now??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Guess As Mutually Friendly As The Time Has Permitted Two People To Be</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Wont Be Speaking To Her Anymore Though</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: why?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: oh yeah, because you said she is blacked out?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: what the heck does that mean!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: It Just Means In A Few Moments From Your Perspective I Wont Be Able To See Her Through My Viewport Or Talk To Her</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Dont Know Why Exactly But Its Not That Hard To Guess</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: She Has Been Relying On The Powers And Counsel Of Dark Gods And Other Sources Of Ambiguous Intent</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And She Has Consequently Devised A Plan Which Sounds Very Dangerous To Me</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yeah, i didnt like the sound of her plan either!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: You Are More Sensible</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Its Probably The Influence Skaia Has Had On You</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Having Spent Much Of Your Life Awake On Prospit</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Like Me</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: you did???????</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: If Were Alike In Some Ways Maybe Its Because Of This</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yeah! :D</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Woke Up A Long Time Ago</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Had Trouble Sleeping When I Was Young</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: The Sunlight Was Unnaturally Invigorating To Me I Guess</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: My Lusus Could Do Nothing To Help</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And When I Was Supposed To Be In My Cocoon I Would Often Wander Out To The Desert</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Where One Day I Was Visited By A Stranger Who Dressed And Spoke In White</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: He Put Me To Sleep And I Awoke On Prospit</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Where I Have Dreamed Ever Since</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: He Said He Was My Guardian</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And Though He Visited Rarely I Did Regard Him As That</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Then Later He Stopped Coming</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: In Time I Began To Believe He Was A Figment Of My Mind</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Like An Imaginary Friend To Give Me Reassurance When I Needed It</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: But Then While Playing Our Game I Learned He Was Real</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: He Had Spoken To Others From Our Party</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And Had Been Manipulating Us All To Advance His Schemes</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: It Was Saddening To Learn My Fortuitous Awakening Had Been The Product Of A Nefarious Ploy</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Youre Lucky That Your Awakening Probably Had No Such Entanglements</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: jeez, i hope not...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: But I Guess Its Only A Minor Contamination Of Something Otherwise Great</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Was Allowed To See What Skaia Would Show Me</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And To Prepare For Dangers Ahead And Try To Protect People</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: me too!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: wow kanaya i did not realize how much we had in common</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Youre Right We Do</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Feel A Bit Silly That It Took Me So Long To Engage With The One Corresponding Closely With My Role</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: It Must Be A Certain Madness Im Afflicted By</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: To Orbit Those More Reckless And Dangerous Than I And More Daring For It</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Guess I Want To Help Them But They Never Can Be Helped It Seems</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: well, it sounds like helping people is something that is in your nature</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i can understand that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: are you saying rose is reckless and dangerous?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes Definitely</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: We Have Our Share Of Dangerous Players Who Seem To Do Nothing But Cause Problems</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Believe She Is Yours</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And If Her Insane Plan Wasnt Alarming Enough</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: She Has Been Communicating With The Stranger I Mentioned</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And Unsurprisingly She Has Not Been Forthright About The Nature Of Their Conversations</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: you mean your guardian?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And Hes Not Merely A Guardian</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Im Very Sure He Is A First Guardian</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Like Your Lusus Was</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: uh oh...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: im not sure why, but the sound of that makes me really nervous</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Feel The Same Way About It</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: The Involvement Of Any Such Entity Strikes Me As Quite Inauspicious</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Even When Seemingly Benign</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: she didnt mention anything about this when we talked</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: but then she seemed preoccupied</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: She Was</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Youll Have A Chance To Determine More Soon</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: After Which Hopefully You Can Tell Me</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yeah, i will!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: In The Meantime I Will Go</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Would Like To Return To The Core To Situate This Orb</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: It Seems You Have Your Own Orb To Care For Now</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: lol yeah i guess so!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: ok, you can go do that, and i guess i will check on rose, but...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: theres still so much i want to know!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i want to know more about stoking the forge and breeding the frogs, and about your time on prospit and all that!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Okay I Will Definitely Help You As Much As I Can</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: The Young Prospit Wakers Ought To Stick Together</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yes! &lt;3</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Ill Message You Again In Your Future</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: And You May Reply If You Have Cause To</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: if i have cause to?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: oh!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: that reminds me, i was thinking of implementing a system to keep some of these confusing conversations simple and linear</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Does It By Any Chance Have To Do With Passwords</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yeah! i guess someone told you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Yes You</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: You Delivered News Of The System By Demanding A Password From Me</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: aaaaa you see??????</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: you nearly just gave me the idea for the plan in the first place paradoxically from my own future self!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i just find that kind of thing annoying for some reason, it doesnt feel right...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i would rather ideas came from the place they actually came from</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Thats A Reasonable Attitude</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: ok lets put the system in play starting now!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i will give you a password, and you give it to me in the future when you want to pick up this conversation again</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Okay</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: the password is...............</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: CROOOOOOOOOOOAK</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: eleven then :p</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: The Password System Is Already Paying Overwhelming Dividends Of Ease And Rationality</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: kanaya :o</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: that sounded</span>

<span style="color: #008141">GA: I Hope Im Not Falling Prey To A Crisis Of Sincerity</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: you are just becoming multicultural, thats all</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: i think i am learning to be more multicultural through karkat as well</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: it mostly involves saying fuck a lot</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008141">GA: Oh No</span>

 <b> 01/26/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005262">"Terezi: Examine Tavros."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Oh my!
<br />

<br />
What have we here???<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/26/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005263">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The upset of the upsetting discovery quickly turns to dismay and grief. Adios, sweet Toreadoormat. 
<br />

<br />
You succumb to emotion. Tears are in order, probably. You attempt a sniffle. A wobble of the lip, even.
<br />

<br />
Alas, the tears will not come. Stupid lousy doomed Dave and your stupid lousy complicity in his death. Getting you all cried out like that.
<br />

<br />
Oh well, whatever. There are more important things at hand to concern yourself with than the flow of teal ocular discharge. A crime has been committed. 
<br />

<br />
And where crime strikes, there is justice to be done.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/26/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005264">"Terezi: Investigate."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The scene is a gruesome spectacle to your nose, otherwise known as a nostacle. Under other circumstances, the aroma could be delightful. A rich chocolatey bouquet, sent from the heavens.
<br />

<br />
But at the scene of this fresh murder, the smell is highly unpalatable. Stomach turning, even. It smells like all the worst things you would expect it to, and more.
<br />

<br />
But a true legislacerator must be steeled to the revolting. Only the truth matters. And if there's one thing that matters even more than the truth, which there is, it's justice. Someone is going to pay.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/26/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005265">"Terezi: Consider suspects."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Before the full investigation is underway, a legislacerator will always have a chief suspect in mind. The one she will hold guilty until proven otherwise, a process customarily taking place after the execution.
<br />

<br />
Even so, it is only prudent to stay open to the possibility of other culprits. As they say in your line of work, there's always room on the gallows for more to swing. And though executing the wrong person is only a minor embarrassment to the courtblock, it is an embarrassment nonetheless. 
<br />

<br />
His Tyranny will surely commend you for your due diligence by graciously neglecting to eat you after the trial.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/26/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005266">"Terezi: Sniff around for clues."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Above, you detect faint traces of what you reckon to be special stardust, such as the kind left behind by the flapping wings of a mischievous fairy.
<br />

<br />
Suspicious indeed.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/26/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005267">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And not far from that, you detect bright trails of white light. It smells... hopeful.
<br />

<br />
Also curious.
<br />

<br />
And that noise. Behind you...<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/26/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005268">"Terezi: Inspect noise."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Oh, of course. It is Gamzee up to his unmistakable charades. He is wandering around somewhere out there in the abyss. 
<br />

<br />
He probably has no idea what sort of danger he is in, with one or more murderers on the loose. Poor guy. You will have to seek him out shortly and offer him protection. You'd feel terrible if you were to lose any more friends.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/26/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005269">"Terezi: Deploy forensics crew."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
But first you must complete your investigation.
<br />

<br />
Professor Pucefoot, Inspector Berrybreath, and Doctor Honeytongue reporting.
<br />

<br />
Your team of forensic scientists is the best there is. There is no bit of evidence which will escape their eager and busy snouts.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/27/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005270">"Terezi: Draw outline."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Professor Pucefoot immediately begins drawing a pointless chalk outline around the body, as is standard protocol.
<br />

<br />
Which is to say, you hold up a piece of chalk to his snout and draw it yourself. Yuck, the chalk is getting blood on it! You will have to discard that color.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/27/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005271">"Terezi: Dust for prints."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You grind up a piece of chalk and dab Inspector Berrybreath's ample plush rump into the powder.
<br />

<br />
You dust the victim's robotic apparatus, revealing nothing. Quite the slippery one you're dealing with.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/27/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005272">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
There are no prints on the victim's face either.
<br />

<br />
THIS WAS SURELY THE WORK OF A MASTER CRIMINAL.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/27/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005273">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The murder weapon however reveals a plethora of prints! Your keen tongue tells you that most of these belong to the victim. But several are unidentified. Hmm... 
<br />

<br />
(You are only pretending to think there is any chance they are not Vriska's, because otherwise it would be no fun.)<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/27/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005274">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The inspector's bottom has become dreadfully bloody though...
<br />

<br />
You believe you will dismiss the inspector.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/27/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005275">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/27/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005276">"Terezi: Get medical report."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
What's that, Doctor Honeytongue? Your analysis is inconclusive? You are recommending a full autopsy of the corpse, you say?<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/27/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005277">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
No, Honeytongue! Are you quite mad???
<br />

<br />
The corpse must not be dismembered just yet! There could still be hope for the victim's resurrection! And according to the legislacerator's handbook, the victim's well being is among the highest of investigative priorities. 
<br />

<br />
The odds that his dream self survived are quite slim, you admit. But you must at least try for the sake of your friend, even if it means braving the awful stench.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/27/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005278">"Terezi: Prepare to revive."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This is not going to be pretty. But what are friends for if they can't smooch each others butchered corpses when the need arises? You will just have to suck it up. You can do it, Terezi.<br><br><br>

 <b> 01/30/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005292">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/30/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005293">"John: Behold puffy oracle."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are transfixed by the haunting mystery and beauty of this cloud's message. How long have you been staring at it? Minutes? Hours? You have begun to lose track of time.
<br />

<br />
What could it be? Two squirming cephalopods locked in a mating ritual? You suppose you will never know.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/30/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005294">"John: Snap out of it."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You somehow manage to pry your eyes from the exquisite celestial projection.
<br />

<br />
You have been exploring the battlefield with a new ally, a friendly fellow who strikes you as a sort of WIZARDLY VASSAL. Your travels have led you here.
<br />

<br />
You spy a WALLET lying on the ground.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/30/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005295">"John: Take wallet."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You pick up the WALLET. It is full of many things. But the first thing to catch your eye is a NOTE.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/30/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005296">"John: Read note."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/30/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005297">"John: Become overwhelmed with responsibility."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are suddenly extremely overwhelmed. How can one boy handle such awesome power and responsibility?
<br />

<br />
You also wonder why your dad dropped his wallet. It's as if he knew you would find it here. Perhaps he has been cloud gazing too?
<br />

<br />
Anyway, you wonder what else he's got in here?<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/30/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005298">"John: Check contents of wallet."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The first card you examine contains ONE TON OF SHAVING CREAM.
<br />

<br />
Your father is nothing if not prepared.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/30/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005299">"WV?: Inspect windy boy's treasure."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Oh goodness, such lovely cargo the boy has produced from his small brown square.
<br />

<br />
The black and white patterns on these little carapaced cylinders are impossibly attractive.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/30/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005300">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You should be careful with that. Do you have any idea how flammable shaving cream is?<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/30/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005301">"WV?: IMBIBE LIKE THE WIND."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You gulp down decadent foamy dollops of the BEARD BUSTER, and quickly respond with the BLUH callback as depicted jostling in the lower right hand corner of the image, because it is not nearly as tasty as you'd hoped.
<br />

<br />
But then you keep eating it anyway.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/30/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005302">"John: Empty wallet."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You don't have all day to be pawing through this thing while your silly friend eats shaving cream. You've already wasted hours staring at mysterious things happening in clouds.
<br />

Time to take a rapid inventory.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/30/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005303">"John: Examine contents."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Look at all this fatherly loot!
<br />

<br />
An inviting PILE OF PIPES, a somewhat less inviting PILE OF RAZOR BLADES, a SPARE CAR, an assortment of SHOES, HATS, and TIES, several issues of THE SERIOUS JESTER, TICKET STUBS TO CIRQUE DU SOLEIL (you would prefer to forget what happened that day, he was just so embarrassing), a BRIEFCASE FULL OF FATHERLY DOCUMENTS, a VARIETY OF PHOTOGRAPHS, a LAPTOP COMPUTER, TEN TONS OF PIPE TOBACCO, and a LIGHTER.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/30/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005304">"John: Examine photographs."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The wallet unsurprisingly contained a series of sentimental photographs of you when you were young. Some of these photos appear to have jokes written on the back. Others, cake recipes.
<br />

<br />
He also kept a series of portraits of some of his favorite comedians. Some are understandable. Harry Anderson goes without saying. Bill Cosby? LIVING FATHERLY LEGEND. But his interest in Mr. Foxworthy always struck you as a little lame. Those redneck jokes were so corny and stupid. You secretly suspected your father was mostly arrested by the man's mustache. Maybe he fantasized about shaving the man's egregious furry lip? This seems like a reasonable theory to you.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/30/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005305">"John: Examine laptop."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Hooray, a computer! You have been dying for a way to talk to your friends again.
<br />

<br />
He bought this laptop at the DADLY DEPOT, an incredibly boring store established to furnish dignified gentlemen everywhere with dull fatherly goods. It was always so boring when he dragged you there. You have no idea who this douche bag is. &quot;Who's this douche bag?&quot; is what you ask every time you see his smug face. Maybe you're being unfair to the man, though.
<br />

<br />
Some guy named Crosby, you guess? Who cares. He's so boring.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/31/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005306">"John: Clean up this mess."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You recaptchalogue the stuff and put it away neatly in your dad's sweet wallet.
<br />

<br />
You are almost done. Just one more thing to...<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/31/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005307">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Oh for the love of...<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/31/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005308">"John: Get in."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Fine. You guess you are going for a little ride.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/31/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005309">"John: Buckle up."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Safety is the most important thing.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/31/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005310">"WV?: Follow suit."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You presume the windy boy knows what he is doing. You tug the dark sash across your chest and secure it.
<br />

<br />
This is an incredible look for you. It's too bad the fashion accessory seems to trap you inside this vehicle. Human fashion and transportation and safety sure are weird, and apparently interrelated.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/31/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005311">"WV?: Ride."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your feet do not reach the little steppy levers.
<br />

<br />
Your copilot points out that you also do not have the key.
<br />

<br />
You are terribly disappointed.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/31/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005312">"John: Just do windy thing already."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
He probably would have been a terrible driver anyway.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/31/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005313">"John and WV?: Ascend."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 02/04/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005332">"Terezi: Return to computer lab."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You foolishly misplaced your glasses during your heroic revival attempt, leaving you with no way of communicating with the others to warn them. This is why you really should carry no less than 5 computers on you at all times, like a sensible person.
<br />

<br />
But there is no one in here. Just someone taking a nap on the horn pile over there.
<br />

<br />
And a big puddle of something next to the transportalizer. Grub sauce maybe? You hope it's grub sauce. Please be grub sauce.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/04/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005333">"Terezi: Sample sauce."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Someone either had a MAJOR sauce accident earlier, or this is the scene of yet another REAL LIFE MURDER! Your team is so lucky to have you around to sleuth these heinous crimes.
<br />

<br />
And yet, the body is missing. Can't conduct much forensic analysis without it. This is EXACTLY why you should never turn your back on a body, not even for a second.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/04/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005334">"Terezi: Examine horn pile."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This was no nap. This was...
<br />

<br />
ANOTHER MURDER.
<br />

<br />
What is going on in this lab???<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/04/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005335">"Terezi: Examine body."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Another textbook impaling. Your perp has been busy tonight.
<br />

<br />
Wait... there appears to be a pair of smaller marks on the victim's neck.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/04/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005336">"Terezi: Examine marks."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Hmm...<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/04/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005337">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Has the killer really developed a taste for blood? She is completely out of control.
<br />

<br />
According to your expert analysis, she barged in here with a lance, her new weapon of choice. This startled everyone in the room so much, it triggered a dreadful grub sauce spill, and/or chainsaw accident, causing the missing victim to lose a large volume of blood, and/or grub sauce. Horrified by the sight, everyone fled the room, except for the present victim who was napping on the horn pile. The perpetrator in her deranged state of mind then sampled the spilt green blood/sauce from the floor. Her thirst piqued, she became tempted by the buffet of rich royal blood on the horn pile, dragged a trail of green from the puddle to the horns, and helped herself to the victim's neck. The victim undoubtedly woke up midway through the gruesome feast, fought back, and got a lance through the chest for her trouble. The perp then fled into the lab, thirsty for more.
<br />

<br />
Yes, you are quite sure that...
<br />

<br />
That...
<br />

<br />
That your theory doesn't make a lick of sense!!! You wish you had your crack team of experts to advise you. If only you hadn't kicked them all into the bottomless pit, along with probably your glasses, accidentally. Damn their insubordination!<br><br><br>

<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i mean, i admit i was pretty confused about it at first, seeing my dead body in the cloud and all...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: but in the end, you did it to help me, didn't you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: really, i should probably be thanking you!</span>

<span style="color: #005682">AG: I know how this is pro8a8ly going to sound, especially to a human.</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: who was it? you mean like, a bad guy?</span>

<span style="color: #005682">AG: Not exactly.</span>

<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut really, that's not why I killed him. He was no match for me, and I could have just incapacit8ed him or flown away or whatever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: The truth is I killed him 8ecause at the time, I thought I wanted to, and sort of felt like I finally had to.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: uh...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: why did you have to?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ecause enough was enough! You don't even know how frustr8ing it was to 8e friends with him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I used to really like him and always wanted to help him get stronger, so that he might stand a fucking chance to actually make it on our world.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut he was just soooooooo weak and indecisive. He wouldn't change!</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Too l8 to kill me.</span>

<br />

<br />

<span style="color: #005682">AG: I mean, yeah, they're fine. 8ut I can't talk to them!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: why not?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: For one thing, they would pro8a8ly just 8e pissed off at me for killing Tavros.</span>

<span style="color: #005682">AG: Horri8le!!!!!!!!</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Do you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: like, trolls are more violent and angry, right? kind of like klingons or something, which is an angry race of alien savages from a human tv show.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: We aren't savages, you dope!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh, i know, that's not what i meant! but i am guessing you all have to act tough to make it in your world, and have a sense of honor about fighting, and like to beat people up and stuff, right?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Uh, yeah........</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Let's say close enough!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: but i think that no matter what alien culture you are from, killing is still wrong!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: and it sounds like you do too.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yeah, see.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: This is where our cultures clash, I think.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It would 8e difficult to explain exactly how killing is viewed on our planet with all the nuance involved.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It just isn't the 8lack and white thing humans seem to think it is!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: well, you could try. i am listening.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: On my world, I would 8e completely vindic8ed for killing him! He is far lower on the hemospectrum than me. He managed to disrespect me time and time again, 8ut I kept letting him live! In fact, the amount of slack I cut him would 8e considered scandalous 8y those in my class.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I had every reason to kill him. And yet...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I feel 8ad a8out it like a lame weak fudge8lood, just like he was.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: And the fact that I feel 8ad is why I'm sort of freaking out right now!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i think if you feel bad, it just means you have a conscience. which is good, right?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: No. That's not how it works.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I'm supposed to 8e just fine with it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: This was sort of like a test, and I'm afraid I might 8e failing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: how was it like a test?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Well, it was the first time I killed some8ody.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: W8! Ok, that's not really true. What I meant was, it was the first time I killed some8ody I cared a8out.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: so...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: you killed other people, that you didn't care about?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yes. Sort of a lot, actually. 8ut there was a really good reason for that!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: hm. how many?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: or... do i want to know...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Oh, it doesn't matter. Pro8a8ly many thousands.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: uhhhhhhhh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: hopy shit...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: God, I know how this sounds! 8ut I had to feed her. My lusus I mean. I've 8asically 8een playing this role as a slave in the food chain my whole life. It is what she selected me to do.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i guess that is why you didn't get along with her?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Hell yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i see.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: still, that is a LOT of killing. jesus...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yeah, 8ut I never felt anything a8out it. It was just normal life for me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: but then you finally killed a guy you liked, and...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: not so cool anymore?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yeah. OH!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Ok, that's not quite right. He's the second person I cared a8out who I killed.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Man, I always forget a8out her!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: uh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I guess she wound up getting me 8ack pretty good though, so we're even.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Oh, also, TECHNICALLY I attempted to kill that same guy around the same time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut I just wound up paralyzing him! Oops, hahahaha.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut man. That was sweeps ago.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I think I had a really juvenile attitude a8out killing 8ack then. I think I was trying too hard?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I was always really o8sessed with 8eing the 8est at stuff, and I guess I was trying to 8e precocious in that respect as well, and prove to everyone how 8rutal I could be.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut I was such a confused kid! I didn't know anything a8out what killing really means. I was trying to fake it, and it caused me nothing 8ut pro8lems.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i guess i had no idea how different we really were.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what i am hearing is seriously scaring the shit out of me!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yeah, I know. I wish we didn't have to 8e so different. I'm just trying to 8e honest with you, 8ecause like I said, I have nowhere else to go.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok, well i appreciate the honesty.</span>
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut I do know what it means grow up as a troll, and what's expected of us.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what does it mean?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: When a troll comes of age, you 8etter 8elieve it means they're going to start killing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It's what we do as a race. We are very effective conquerors, and as such, we practically domin8 our galaxy. Or... used to.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: that sounds terrible!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i would like to be culturally sensitive, but i wish it didn't have to be like that for you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i have started to really like you guys!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Well, thanks John. That's nice of you to say. 8ut let's face it, it doesn't fucking matter anymore, since our whole race was wiped out!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: May8e for the 8est, when you think a8out it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: :(</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut at least paradox space gave us some purpose 8efore wiping us out, right?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: At least we got the chance to cre8te you guys, and all those twinkly stars you used to look up at.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yeah, that's true.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: So 8ecause we got that chance, it means we'll never actually get to come of age and enter troll society, and see if we got what it takes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut that doesn't mean we stop growing up!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I think the game knows it's always gonna 8e played 8y kids, and it always rigs it so they enter right around the cusp of sexual maturity, whatever the race is.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Which kinda makes sense, since if they succeed, they've got their whole lives ahead of them to do whatever the hell they're going to do in their universe, like start repopul8ing and whatnot.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: That means the game also knows it's got to deal with all these damn kids who are coming of age while playing it!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I really think how successfully they mature is tied to success in the game. It challenges the players in all the ways they need to 8e challenged to grow, which is different for every individual, and veeeeeeeery different for every race.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I don't think we were so hot at that aspect of the game. In fact, I'm sure we were quite awful. Hell, even I wasn't that gr8 at it! I actually just kinda fell ass 8ackwards into the god tier, to 8e honest.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: hehe... yeah me too. :)</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut what really gets me is this didn't even occur to me until just now, while I was sitting around thinking a8out it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It was so o8vious!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: That was why the game split us up into two teams.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It knew as we came of age, we'd pro8a8ly start killing each other.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: So it just provided the stage. Red team vs. 8lue. It was so simple! All we had to do was what we were naturally inclined to. It might have worked out 8etter for us.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: uh...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i don't really see how you guys killing each other would help you play the game better!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yeah, you'd think that would 8e counter productive! 8ut then again, may8e not.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: If we really did take the team thing seriously, and started killing each other, may8e it would have meant more god tiers?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: May8e all of us would have made it????????</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Damn, can you imagine? We would have 8reezed through the game even faster, killed the king without a sweat. May8e claimed the reward 8efore Jack even showed up?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Or if he did, may8e we could have 8eaten him then and there instead of scurrying off like cowards!!!!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: In retrospect we failed at this so spectacularly, I am amazed, and kind of ashamed.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It turned out that the only one of us with the guts to kill someone was already DEAD! Hahahahahahahaha. And 8oy, did I have it coming.</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: dead?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yes, she was a ghost, and then 8ecame a ro8ot. Then she 8ecame a THOUSAND ro8ots. Then Jack killed them all 8ut one. Then she 8lew up.</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: your team is so crazy!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Not crazy enough, apparently!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Actually, this is pro8a8ly Karkat's fault.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: how?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: When it comes down to it, he was pro8a8ly too good a leader! He actually did manage to get the two teams to work together toward the same goal. It could have easily deterior8ed into a feud otherwise.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: He was just so loud and annoying and o8sessed with leadership. He wouldn't shut up! So it was just easier to go along with his plans.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: huh...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yeah, i can see how that could be true.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: He sure kept us working together, 8ut in the end I think we paid for it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It wasn't natural! Pretty fitting, really, since he's kind of a freak himself. He's not even on the hemospectrum, the weirdo.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I really dou8t he would have handled it as a leader if the shit ever hit the whirling device.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: He likes to pretend he's all vicious and 8loodthirsty, 8ut I know he 8n't got that in him. I have a sense for these things.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: He'd 8e so pissed if he heard me say this, 8ut I think he'd cut it 8etter as a human than as a troll.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: you probably mean that as an insult, but i think it is a nice compliment!</span>
<br />

<br />
You reflect on your prior experience as the team's ectobiologist. It seemed like you were doing something so important at the time. Finally everything made sense. This was why you were here.
<br />

<br />
But what was the point? You are all clearly going to die the most pointless deaths possible. Everything you believed about your destiny was meaningless. You wish you never pushed those buttons and hatched your team out of all this goddamn slime. You are no ectobiologist. If only there was some other title more befitting of the true discipline you practice, and the death sentence given to whatever you do the disservice of creating. You can't think of one though.
<br />

<br />
And what about the OTHER twelve wigglers you spawned? Who were they? Probably further proof this was all meaningless and random. Could it be that they were the true heroes meant to be sent back to play this game, while your team was the superfluous crop? Could a mistake have been made during the reckoning? 
<br />

<br />
Or just maybe, she was right about them all along. Not that it makes any difference now.
<br />

<br />
Something is stirring behind you. Something unconscious and toothless.<br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Hmmmmmmmm.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: that would be a constructive way to use your killer troll instincts, even by human standards.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: it is much better than killing friends.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yeah, you're right.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: And to tell you the truth, part of the reason I wanted to kill him was to protect them. It's not just a8out glory you know.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ecause if I don't do it, then who will?</span>

<span style="color: #005682">AG: I guess two plans are 8etter than one, right?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yeah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: so...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: will you go fight him then?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Man, I don't know anymore.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It's one reason I'm freaking out a8out this. A8out feeling 8ad a8out a simple, perfectly justifia8le killing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: If I can't handle that, doesn't it mean I'm not as strong as I thought? What hope do I have against Jack if that's the case?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: for whatever it's worth coming from a human, feeling remorse doesn't make you weak!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i bet you are still really strong.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: but then, i'm not sure if i actually want to encourage you to go off fighting him...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: because as strong as you probably are, it sounds like he is REALLY strong.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: and even though you killed tons of people, i think i would still be pretty sad if you died.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Aw. ::::)</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: so maybe you should just let us handle it? at least we won't fight him directly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I don't know. Even though I'm conflicted, it still feels like something I have to do.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I admit, I'm pretty scared thinking a8out it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Not of him necessarily, 8ut of the fact that I apparently don't know myself as well as I 8elieved.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: What if I'm not as lucky as I thought?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: What if I do not in fact have ALLLLLLLL of the luck?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: well, maybe you don't?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: all of the luck sounds like an awful lot of luck to have.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Exactly!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut then, if there is no chance of catching a 8ad 8r8k, then taking a risk doesn't even qualify as 8r8very, does it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It isn't even a risk, 8y definition!!!!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: So if this is going to mean anything, I guess I just have to find the strength from somewhere to go through with it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: More than just the fakey strength that comes from turning a 8lind eye to all your flaws. You know what I mean?</span>

<span style="color: #005682">AG: It was so thrilling reading it. It really felt like she wrote it just for me, like she was talking right to me and telling me how to 8e like her.

More wine for the lady?
<br />

<br />
This woman sure does seem to like her wine. The gentleman has never met a woman quite so taken with the drink, or one as enchanting and beautiful, for that matter.

<br />
The fellow has stained the mademoiselle's fine garment. The gaffe is unforgivable, and the only true course of chivalry would be to liberate the damsel from the sodden cloth and launder it immediately.
<br />

<br />
But the lady has no concern for the purity of her finery. She has other things on her mind altogether.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/13/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005402">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The woman has never met a gentleman so strong and considerate and handsome. She cannot tell for certain if her intoxication is due to her seventh glass of wine, or the contours of his proud, powerful nose, and the sensual aroma wafting from his pipe.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/13/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005403">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

The man and the woman are at ease. They have everything because they have each other. They know that together they can make it through anything, whether trouble brings a bit of spilled wine on a chic lab coat, or reduces the very castle beneath their feet to ruins.<br><br><br>

<br />

<br />
The Orphaner poses a caliginous riddle like no other I've met. I am presuming him 8othered 8y jealousy, and it would 8e sickening if it were not so marvelously amusing. 8ut then, who 8ut royalty could have the finned cheek to show disdain for the manner in which his 8lack lover conducts her red conquests? Less has acceler8ted meeker than I to homicide, and the viol8tion would hold me aghast, again, if his misgivings did not complement his so endearing arsenal of qu8nt flaws. It is impossi8le to stifle this grin even now as I write.
<br />

<br />
He surely understands this as my maritime overlord, a superior while through gritting fangs he would concede the expanse of my plunder makes his seem hardly worthwhile to trou8le a map with good ink over. I know he understands. I will take what I want. I expect nothing less from Dualscar, and truly, less would offend me. Is it the crude 8lood of the suitors from which I have taken enjoyment recently? If his displeasure is with my 8lithe treatment of the social order then he has either not spent enough time in the warm company of my indifference, or is simply very stupid. I saw the look he gave. He's so secure in knowing I can't feel what's in his mind he forgets the tr8torous ways of his own face. His little looks are words to me, interjections in our deliciously 8itter repartee. First a look as I summon a slave from the hold, with such ease 8etween my remarks. Why yes, Dualscar, they were the very slaves in your hold until 8ut this hour. Another ship deployed carelessly, languishing in strategic vulnera8ility. Is this not our routine? Our dance? What is this look, my dear kismesis? Is it shame? Envy? Contempt for what he knows will follow?
<br />

<br />
I nod her over. She is fearful and it makes her prettier. He scoffs without a movement or sound. I know there is disgust feeding the shadows in his corner of my 8lock. At least prick her in the light, he surely thinks. Determine what vulgar hue she 8leeds 8efore persisting with your a8asement, Marquise. Do try to understand, Orphaner. Not knowing is the point, and if you truly understood this, your crusade against the Gam8lignants would not 8e among our Grand High8lood's most uproarious punchlines. (If only one truly needed to 8e so high to find it amusing!) And so not knowing, I take her will, 8ut leave enough of it to enjoy her response. Her hands are in my service 8ut they still shake. They unfasten the first 8utton at my jacket's waist, clumsily. I have masked the line 8etween my puppeteering and her volition exquisitely, and her uncertainty over her own control fuels her fear. She unfastens the second 8utton, and 8etween the second and third, I make a casual remark to Dualscar, continuing our convers8tion. He does not respond.
<br />

<br />
I look again at the face of my slave, imagining for a moment her mind is not an unguarded port to her every dread. I imagine I cannot feel her conviction that it's not merely a matter of whether she will 8e put to the irons, 8ut how hot they will 8e if she fails to please. Poor thing. Her horns make attractive shapes and pair themselves pleasantly amidst her violent snarls of hair. Her fingers, which I have lost track of, to my surprise have come 8etween the petticoat and my skin. The heat of her touch tells me the likely range for the color of her 8lood. I wouldn't have guessed it to look at her, not with her sign stripped. Her mouth opens slightly and I squint. Ah! Razor sharp, and none missing. Perfect. How disappointing it is to find quivering lips hiding dull teeth. I pause to consider. What will her fear 8ecome if I choose to show her mercy later? And even, in days, kindness? Will this 8e the red dalliance that 8ecomes fully flushed? Love demands my cunning just as my raids. If it is to 8e, she will never understand how thoroughly she was manipul8ted, her 8ody, her mind, her devotion.
<br />

<br />
I remem8er Dualscar again. My distraction from our 8anter was momentarily a8solute, and I inquire into the shadows. 8ut he is gone. 
<br />

<br />
Then go, my kismesis. Fume with the indign8tion I gave you. I can only pray it 8lackens our 8ond. I must know such exhi8itions agit8 him and hence why I 8other, otherwise it would 8e easy to dismiss him 8efore I partook. Let it 8e a gift of antagoniz8tion to you, my dear rival, on which you may 8rew pitch for me anew. And if it is true envy, a vermilion yearning I can't a8ide, then though it pains me it will 8e farewell.
<br />

<br />
Alas, it may 8e that I am too good at spurring h8. Too good, at least, for him. I only hope he is not so foolish as to tread a path of less torrid malice.
<br />

<br />
For if he does........</span><br><br><br>

My suspicions have 8een confirmed. I'm not grinning anymore, Dualscar.
<br />

<br />
Our orderly contention has dissolved right 8efore my vision 8fold. It was once a handsome 8lack, 8ut now sits like good strong tea sullied and cooled 8y unwelcome dairy.
<br />

Thus my heart was 8roken twice. I was fond of the slave. There was surely promise in her red investment. He had her assassin8ed.</span><br><br><br>

Doesn't he remem8er what he's confided? It would 8e easy to give the evidence to Her Imperious Condescension, and he would 8e killed quickly for his unthinka8le presumption.

I've learned Dualscar has reported to the Grand High8lood all the intelligence he has on me and my fleet. It was inform8tion he'd guarded closely to protect our once mutually cherished rivalry. He couldn't let it fall into the wrong hands, lest another 8esiege me more effectively and cause me to wax for the usurper. Not that he'd raised that mast particularly high himself. Ah, the shortcomings I manage to overlook for the sake of a lover.
<br />

<br />
I would have enjoyed witnessing the entertainment he prepared to please the High8lood. His sense of humor was dreadful. It would have 8een a true miracle if he survived the appointment.
<br />

<br />
Funny, I always imagined a grander entry in my journal for your demise, Dualscar. 8ut I should have realized you would die as you lived. A joke. One more humorous little sacrifice kindly given to the Su8juggl8ors, and one step closer to the release of the Vast Honk they prophesize.

Wait. He says he just means girl. Just girl. You didn't hear any of that.
<br />

<br />
You don't say anything.
<br />

<br />
He says fine. You win. Sic the stupid droll on her, what does he care.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/21/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005460">"DD?: Contact CD?."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You hit up the droll. The slayer was right, this guy is clearly incompetent. Still, the only real objective here is to get him to stop breathing down your neck with his awful dog breath.
<br />

<br />
Looks like the droll's on the battlefield. He says he is still looking for the queen's ring. He says he made a new friend to help him with his search. But it is terribly breezy on this planet, and his new friend keeps blowing around making the search more difficult! He says thank goodness he is not wearing one of his finer hats. It would be just dreadful trying to keep it on his head in such weather!
<br />

<br />
You say you don't care about any of that stuff, and tell him to shut up.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/21/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005461">"CD?: Listen to DD?."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The dignitary is one of your superiors who makes you nervous. The list of superiors who make you nervous in fact includes all of your superiors. It includes many of your inferiors as well.
<br />

<br />
He tells you to forget the ring. You failed your mission, and you are never going to find it. There is a new mission. You say oh? He says yeah. And let go of the goddamn rabbit. You say ok, but don't actually let go.
<br />

<br />
You say you will be happy to begin the new mission very soon. But first there is this pretty blue tornado ahead you were meaning to investigate. Perhaps other locals it has attracted will know something about the ring? He says for the love of god, will you forget about the tornado and the ring. You don't say anything and look longingly at the tornado again. He says fine, if you really must examine a meaningless and extraordinarily dangerous exhibit of meteorological phenomena, then go ahead. But be ready to embark on the mission not a moment later. You say alright, and wonder what you should do to prepare. He asks if you have a good winter hat.
<br />

<br />
You nearly drop the radio in excitement.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/22/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005462">"Jack: Wait."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
There. Now that those wheels are in motion, you guess you can put your mind at ease for a while. You find nothing quite so troubling as the intrusion of a positive emotion.
<br />

<br />
You are momentarily afforded the peace of mind to resume a dull, quiet life of semi-restrained murder. Maybe you will wait here and see if the boy shows up. It's reasonable to assume he will seek these adults. Certainly easier to let him come to you than follow an untraceable scent. Or maybe you will take a look inside this castle. Perhaps there are survivors here fit for the offing? You GUESS that could serve some amusement.
<br />

<br />
You wonder if it will always be like this. What sort of future does a new god have to look forward to? Will this malaise follow you for eternity? Will you be perpetually tempted to destroy everything you see, knowing that in just a few moments of recklessness, you will be left with nothing else to destroy forever? What will eternity feel like when a single moment of boredom feels like an eternity unto itself?
<br />

<br />
You wish you could consult the clouds for answers. But they never show you anything. The reckoning can't wipe this place out soon enough.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/22/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005463">"Be future Jack Noir."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are now future Jack Noir.
<br />

<br />
Presently, you are trapped in a single moment, which increasingly feels like an eternity. Your boredom is surpassed only by your all consuming rage and contempt for existence itself.
<br />

<br />
Hours ago, you entered an unfamiliar session. You killed a thousand robotic assailants. You destroyed twelve planets with ease, methodically and cyclically, like a single stained hand of a defective clock smearing each number it passes. You reduced Prospit and Derse to dust, and murdered a whole bunch of alien kids in yellow and purple pajamas. Your warpath of absolute devastation had only begun to be blazed; there were still miles and bloody miles to send forth. But when the dust of Derse settled, this infuriating fairy appeared out of thin air and froze you in time. But she can't keep you like this forever. And when she finally lets you go, you will be ready. 
<br />

<br />
What will you do?
<br />

<br />
Aside from nothing, that is.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/22/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005464">"Jack: Wait."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You attempt to be patient. 
<br />

<br />
You fail miserably.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/22/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005465">"Be Aradia."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are now the Maid of Time, recently resurrected from the crypt of Derse. Your name is Aradia Megido, and for the first time in your life, you feel truly alive.
<br />

<br />
You have just incapacitated Jack Noir with a spell. But a demon so powerful requires your full concentration to subdue. He will break free any moment. You may release him, and die now. Or you may continue to hold him, and die later.
<br />

<br />
What will you do? 
<br />

<br />
Aside from die, that is.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/22/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005466">"Aradia: Release him."</a></b><br><br>

Which would you prefer I call you? It's one of the strange points of uncertainty which surrounds you. Maybe it is that you don't particularly care. Your flair is for the plain and serviceable, isn't it? Not much of your vanity is tied up in a name, I'd guess.

Not going to tell me? Fine, I won't tell you my name either.

Well, I might. If you would just show some manners and stop hitting me with that ridiculous horse hitcher. I won't crack no matter how senseless the drubbing. If only it were that simple.

You're not going to stop, are you. It will be very difficult to discuss our points of mutual interest like this. I was prepared to go about it in a civilized way, even though I knew very well I would spend the first several minutes of our meeting sitting on the floor while being flogged. I have even prepared a bowl of candy for you, which I know you will enjoy. Courtesy is important, Jack.

It's a good nickname too. Befitting of the passive gunslinger charged with initiating the break. I am my master's weapon. His soldier in a war of one bullet fired. But when that bullet clears the barrel, it won't be my finger on the trigger. I'm a facilitator, not an assassin.</span>]<br><br><br>

<span style="color: #ffffff">But I can say that I have never played a prank on you, and no statement I have made to you thus far, or will make in this conversation, will contain any trace of falsehood for the sake of setting up a joke or a prank, with the exception of the joke I just made, and another one I will make very soon.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm starting to change my mind.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Oh?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes. I think your joke was funny in retrospect. Actually, your whole shtick is pretty good. I'm warming up to it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes. I knew it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Just to be clear,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Was the assurance you just made a prank or a joke?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">It was neither. It was the truth.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Was that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The truth?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Were you serious about wanting to die?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Why?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I'll tell you later.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Why?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Because you asked.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But why not now?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Because that piece of information would not fit elegantly into the sequence of our exchange at this moment.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then you know how this entire conversation will go?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Is that true of all conversations you have?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes. Until, briefly, I don't. But the dark spots never last long. The truth disguises itself to me sometimes which can be mildly frustrating, but it usually reveals itself quickly, much as if a punchline was delivered. It's a humorous dialogue I have with reality, and it is very amusing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then why do you bother with the conversations? Obligation to predestination, as usual?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">There is no obligation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">It's a pleasure.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It is?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I've always had a soft spot for young ladies.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Hmm.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That's a little creepy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">No it's not.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes it is.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">No it's not.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It kind of is.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I have looked into the future and determined that we would continue in this manner pointlessly for some time, so I am putting an end to it here.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That doesn't make sense.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Was that the other joke?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Heh. Good one.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Thank you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: How young are the ladies you typically take a shining to?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And does this mean you are attracted to me?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Suddenly this conversation is kind of terrible.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Of course I am not. Not in the way you mean.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">And anyway, you are applying standards of conduct frowned upon for your kind which make no sense to apply to me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I am an immortal entity with a large cue ball for a head, and no biological means of reproduction.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: ...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Really.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Also, if you were millions of years old, you would find that nearly every lady you encounter is quite young, relatively speaking.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">There should be no reason for you to feel uncomfortable with this interaction. Try to think of me as one of your kindly human uncle figures.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">In fact, if I were in your presence now, I would offer you candy to prove it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Oh my god.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">What?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Can we talk about the scratch instead of this?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span><br><br><br>

<span style="color: #ffffff">You are situated near the game construct supplied by your session for causing the Scratch, yes?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Are you actually asking?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">That was a fact, and then a question mark.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Well, yes, I am.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's a large plateau shaped like a record. It's called the Beat Mesa.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I know.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Is the game construct different in other sessions?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">It will always be an edifice of similarly cryptic design, located on the planet that is home to the Hero of Time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Its environment dictates the nature of its construction. Its power is dangerous, and is meant to be utilized only in emergencies such as yours.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You mean, in sessions where victory is no longer possible?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Due to creating an unstoppable adversary? Who triggers the reckoning prematurely?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Is that sort of emergency common?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Failure is common. But the composition of yours is quite atypical.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then, it's like a panic button for the players to push once they realize the cause is lost.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes, but causing the Scratch is not an easy task either.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">The construct must be destroyed in a very specific way to release its energy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">The keeper of my ectobiological father began the process.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">It must be finished.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Who?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">The guardian of the Knight of Time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Dave's bro?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: How do I finish it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">You don't.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Not you personally. Another will. You have something more important to attend to, remember?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Oh, right.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The Green...</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'd planned to take care of that later, once John had retrieved the Tumor.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Tumor.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Whatever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Your plan will have to change.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">You aren't ready to cause the Scratch yet.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Like I said, it's difficult.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What will the one who does it have to do? I should let them know.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">He will have to scratch the surface of the plateau across its full diameter.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I see.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: This terminology can be very literal sometimes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">You will require a certain needle to create a breach in the surface that will be adequate.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I have needles.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Your needles won't suffice.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then where do I get ones that will?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Again, you won't. This task is out of your hands.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">The needles must be acquired from the denizen of the Witch of Space.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Her quills are very large and potent. They will be able to cause the Scratch.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: This really seems more elaborate than you lead me to believe.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I didn't lead you to believe anything.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I told you to find the construct and await advisement on the Scratch. The plans you were making were based on assumptions and fabrications of your imagination. You were writing more stories, much like those about your false magical men.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I wish what I'd written in my private journals could be confined to your dark spots.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I don't. I find your stories entertaining.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You're being creepy again.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">No I'm not.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Besides, the White King agrees with me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">For a Seer, your vision of events surrounding you is rather limited. It's charming.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Just,</span>

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Fine.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then please at least try to sound more sarcastic when you do it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Oh sure, I am really going to do that. Yes, very likely.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: ...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then the Scratch will be implemented later, by either John or Dave I presume?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You used a male pronoun.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I guess it makes sense that it would happen later. My understanding is that Jack will not be banished from this session until near the end of the reckoning.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes, Jack will exit your session later, but this has nothing to do with the Scratch.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Not directly, as you imply.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I don't understand.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I thought that was the point of the Scratch, to open a rift in spacetime as it were, and banish him into the trolls' session.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">That is not the purpose of the Scratch at all. The Scratch does not open a rift in spacetime.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Hmm.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then why have you directed me to cause it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Does it have something to do with enabling you to die?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">No. Not directly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">The Scratch has nothing more to do with my death than any other single event ultimately contributing to my demise.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I think it's disingenuous for you to behave as if I have not been misled.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You say you don't lie, but what about lies of omission?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Lies of omission do not exist.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">The concept is a very human one. It is the product of your story writing again. You have written a story about the truth, making emotional demands of it, and in particular, of those in possession of it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Your demands are based on a feeling of entitlement to the facts, which is very childish. You can never know all of the facts. Only I can.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">And since it's impossible for me to reveal all facts to you, it is my discretion alone that decides which facts will be revealed in the finite time we have.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">If I do not volunteer information you deem critical to your fate, it possibly means that I am a scoundrel, but it does not mean that I am a liar. And it certainly means you did not ask the right questions.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">One can make either true statements or false statements about reality. All of the statements I make are true.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Unless you're joking.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Haa haa, hee hee, hoo hoo?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Exactly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then I guess I'll start asking better questions.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Good.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I will make a Seer of you yet.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Will you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">You can start by shoring up the reliability of your sources. You proceeded to question me believing you understood the purpose of the Scratch. You received your information about it from trolls. I assure you that in most ways, the trolls are as confused about everything as you are.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ok. Noted.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What exactly does the Scratch do, then?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">It resets the game.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Oh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That's it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: We all start from the beginning again? When John entered?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">The release of temporal energy will be quite massive.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">This is a hard reset. It will reboot the conditions in your universe well before you began playing the game.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">You will have lived different lives after the reset. The different initial conditions will ideally lead to a more favorable scenario in the new session.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Unfortunately, you will have no memory of anything that has happened in the session you are in now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What will happen to us? Everyone in this session now?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">You will all cease to exist completely if you remain here during the Scratch.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: This seems familiar.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It reminds me of when Dave and I were trapped in the doomed timeline, and he left to change the past.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The timeline ceased to exist, along with my dream self, who in a way became merged with my dream self of this timeline. I kept some of her memories.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Is the situation similar?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Similar, but more severe.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Since this timeline will undergo such a violent upheaval, such a merger of memory cannot happen.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">You will be resigned to absolute oblivion.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Unless you can discover a way to preserve yourselves.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">But it's not really my place to advise you on that.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then can you at least tell me if we will be successful in preserving ourselves after the reset?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I don't particularly enjoy spoiling things for people when unnecessary.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I find speaking in a discreet color helps avoid this.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So if the Scratch isn't specifically meant to banish Jack from the session,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And our quest to destroy the sun is meant to kill him,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Why is the reset necessary at all, especially if it means oblivion for us?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Because you cannot achieve the ultimate reward in this session.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Your battlefield is cancerous, and the reckoning will destroy it prematurely regardless.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">By resetting, you will create a session which can bear the fruit of a new universe, even if you will not be the ones to claim the reward.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Don't you want to fulfill your purpose?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I guess.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But it's a little disheartening to learn I'm now faced with not one, but two suicide missions at once.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: One to destroy Jack's power source and defend all of existence, and another to ensure our cosmic progeny at the price of oblivion.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">That frames the dual objectives accurately.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">But if you are inventive, you may find a way to survive the reset and participate in the renewed session.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">It's up to you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Just as it's up to you to face the decision to claim immortality before you enter your creation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Immortality?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Do you mean ascending to the god tier?</span>

<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I have reason to believe that I won't.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The trolls have not indicated I will die on my Quest Bed, or that any of us will aside from John. Instead I've been given a more troubling and ambiguous forecast.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">What have I said about confirming the reliability of your sources?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Are you saying I will?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Oh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Well, will I?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">It seems you'd like me to do some more fortune telling.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Fine.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Maybe this question will suit you better.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Is it probable?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">That's a strange question to ask someone who is omniscient and therefore knows outcomes with one hundred percent certainty.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I like it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then what's your answer?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">You have exactly a fifty percent chance of ascending to the god tier.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That's a strange answer.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I know.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Why such a precise probability?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Because, much like the decisions you must face to complete your dual suicide missions, you have two ways of achieving godhood to choose from.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Two ways?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Where?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">What difference does it make? You already know where the first one is. You have the choice to go there right now and take your own life.</span>

<span style="color: #ffffff">Of course it is.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: How are those terms defined?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Broadly, mysteriously, and according to the case of the individual.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">One may be killed by opposing a corrupt adversary and die for a just cause, as through martyrdom, for instance. This would be heroic.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Or one may be subject to corruption, and slain by a hero. This would be just.</span>

<span style="color: #ffffff">Neither. I'm not a god.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I'm a guardian, a servant, and a weapon.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I have power and knowledge far surpassing a god.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">But I am not one.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Is this when you are going to tell me why you want to die?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I sense it's not just because you're getting bored with immortality.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">That's good. Your vision is becoming clearer.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then why?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">My master can't enter this universe until I am killed.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Such is the nature of the break.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That almost sounds like martyrdom. Are you sure it won't be a hero's death?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Quite sure.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">My master is a very evil man.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Who is he?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I won't tell you his name.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">But he goes by the title, </span><span style="color: #2ed73a">L</span><.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/o.gif" border="0" /><span style="color: #2ed73a">rd English</span><span style="color: #ffffff">.</span><br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: This doesn't sound like an especially admirable objective. Releasing an evil man, who is presumably more powerful than you, an already omnipotent being.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Am I right?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">You are right about both. It is not admirable, and he is considerably more powerful.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">But you must decide which objective is more important.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">You may decide to attempt to destroy the sun and end my life. This will neutralize Jack, who is also much more powerful and dangerous than myself by virtue of the ring he wears in addition to drawing energy from the same sun as I. He poses a significant threat to reality.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But in the process of killing him and you, I release your master, who is just as deadly?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">He's more deadly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">But the danger he poses is sanctioned by paradox space.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">It is a known quantity. His very existence in a universe will mean it will inevitably be torn apart.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">But there are rules to his entry, and his grim procession through paradox space is rather orderly. The present equilibrium has accounted for him, and will continue to.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Jack however is a loose cannon. He will not stop until he destroys everything he encounters.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Additionally, his existence is your responsibility.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then I guess I don't have a choice.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">You do.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">But also know this.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Refusing to venture out to destroy the sun in no way spares anyone from my master regardless.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">It is certainly true that destroying it will end my life.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">And it is certainly true that </span><span style="color: #000000">The Tumor</span><span style="color: #ffffff"> you will deliver to its location has enough power to destroy it completely.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">But it is not the only way to kill me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">It is simply a way I have suggested to you, which doubles as a way to disarm Jack, should you choose to go through with it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Instances of myself have spawned in countless universes, and my objective is always the same.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I have never once failed to complete this objective, and I never will.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">There is nothing noble about taking a course of action you believe would prevent his arrival, because that is impossible.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">He will come.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">In fact, he is already here.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Are you saying that I will succeed in the mission to destroy the sun?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Are you asking for another palm reading?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: ...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">You seem rather keen on acquiring a fortune from me considering you are the one with the crystal ball.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm just trying to ask as many questions as I can. It's the only way to find the dark spots in your obstinacy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I've been very helpful. And I will continue to be.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I myself do not care to be an oracle. But I can graciously supply you with one.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Can you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">An eager consort has brought you one of my seeds. It appears you have amassed followers who wish to please you. How fortuitous.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Your seeds?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">The white orb.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Oh. The cue ball. How did I not notice this?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">It will accurately answer any question a curious girl can pose.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Provided she can see through the surface to read its reply.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Hmm.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Is that possible?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Is it, Seer?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Given your title and all the tools of prognostication at your disposal, it seems to me I should be the one asking you the questions.</span><br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: How can I see through it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">It seems you weren't listening, so I will state this again in the form of a question.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Don't you think I should be asking the questions from now on?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes, if you wanted to be disingenuous and irritating.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Don't you think a clever person should be able to acquire information from someone who only asks questions?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Then it's a challenge!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I pass.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Do you have a choice? What if I'm feeling a bit stubborn?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ok, so what you mean is I should continue humoring your leading questions until you happen to ask certain rhetorical questions that contain information I need.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Was that a question?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That was a fact, and then a period.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">How does a Seer see?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: ...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: With a crystal ball?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I already considered that. I don't think I can get the focus of the ball to &quot;zoom in&quot; tight enough on the cue ball's enclosure to read the answers.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">How else does she see?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: By other magical means, I guess.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Should I use magic?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Do you believe in magic?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Magic is real.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I've been using it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Are you sure?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Use whatever word you want to describe it. I have magic wands, they are very powerful, and they allow me to be magic. Your questions are silly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">What makes you convinced the wands are responsible for your abilities?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Because I did not have the abilities before I made them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Could this be circumstantial?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Could it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Is there an echo?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Is there an echo?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Hee hee?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I don't know what you're getting at.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: How about another leading question?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">What did you combine to make those wands?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Some stuff.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Knitting needles?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">An inexpensive figurine of some fictional fellow with long whiskers?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">A simple textbook on the zoologically dubious?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Why would this mundane combination of objects grant a child such an alarming mastery over dark forces all at once?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm guessing this is one of the rhetorical questions meant to be informative.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So then, my answer should affirm how ridiculous that sounds, shouldn't it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Maybe?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That wasn't even a question.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes it was?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ok. Magic is fake, the wands are useless toys, and there is something else going on. Next question???</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Would it be so difficult to believe the power you've found to devastate your planet and create shortcuts through your session is not entirely by your own device?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Would it be so difficult to believe a young lady could be unwittingly apprenticed by more powerful entities who meant her potential to be realized later through some arbitrary trigger?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">What would you say if I said a dutiful girl raised in the daylight was protected by a bulb-headed guardian, and learned to glow in the dark after death?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">What would you say if I said a vengeful boy on a path of nihilism was taken under the wings of fearsome angels, and learned to destroy hope with their light?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">What would you say if I said a reserved girl enamored by what dwelt in shadow was selected by the horrorterrors for service, and did their bidding at every step while convinced of her own autonomy?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What would I say to those short fables?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Not much, except I gather the third is a story about me, and that there's a lesson you'd like me to take from it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That I should renounce my &quot;allegiance&quot; before my grimdark corruption is absolute.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And while I'm at it, I should discard these useless wands, because apparently the power was in my little black heart all along. Is that right?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Won't you have to give up your specibus to the one who causes the Scratch regardless?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">How else will the young man wield that great big needle?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I don't know! If you say so.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Haven't your friends already shown concern for your recklessness and your increasing sense of detachment from the party, the team objectives, and not to mention those of your personal quest?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Does this worry you? Is there a part of you left that's able to worry?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes. It has been mysteriously localized to my middle finger. Could the dark magics be at work AGAIN?!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Do you deny that you have been neglecting incoming messages from your teammates? Would that be in keeping with the spirit of the human emotion of friendship for one whose soul was not so befouled by the designs of unknowable monstrosities?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Friendship isn't an emotion, numbnuts.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Isn't it, Rose?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Isn't it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I've been busy. I'll get back to them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And can we please stop doing the patronizing question thing?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: In exchange I promise I will discontinue my patronizing responses.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Can the omniscient be patronized?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The omniscipotent can do whatever they please. I guess I'm just asking you nicely to do me this favor.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Very well. I will stop smothering you with surprise noodles.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Huh?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">But only because I find you to be adorable.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So creepy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">So cute.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yuck.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">I am going to ask the same question I asked earlier.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Please do not regard it as a violation of my pledge. It is just an ordinary question, like those that crop up in an ordinary conversation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">How does a Seer see?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I don't know.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Be literal.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: With her eyes?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Take the orb.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Ask it a question.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I don't know what to ask anymore.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">What would you ask me?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I would ask what should I do next.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Then ask.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What should I do next?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Not me.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: For some reason, despite all the danger, I never thought she was in any trouble.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I never believed she would actually die.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I grew up with the feeling that something more significant had always been meant for her.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That she was a heroine displaced in some way, resigned to the inglorious duty of raising me, and preparing me in her way.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I didn't actually need the ectobiological verification that she was like a mother and a sister at the same time. I always understood that somehow.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: And I felt she had knowledge and ability beyond what she let on. It was always intimidating, but nonetheless a source of respect which was childishly begrudging on my part.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I think she was just waiting for me to catch up with her.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: yeaaah...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So if my course of action is to change on account of my mood, it can only become less impetuous, don't you think?</span>

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Maybe it was a terrible plan.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I could stop being so cowardly, for once.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I could short circuit this endlessly expanding game of chess we're playing, just like Jack decided to do.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: but what if they are not actually good?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: They are enormous, ugly, and live in darkness.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That doesn't necessarily make them bad.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: no...</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It advised me to talk to you just now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So I guess so.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: then maybe you should try it!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">Yes, Rose. Listen to Jade.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ffffff">She is far less manipulative than I.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What are you suggesting I ask it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: well</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: since we dont know much about the gods...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">GG: why dont you ask it about them?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So, you're saying I should ask it if the gods are evil?</span>

You and your rabbit friend approach a gentleman wrapped in a fine white cloth, and his courageous cohort, a young man riding a great gust of wind!

 <b> 03/22/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005569">"John: Reunite with Liv Tyler."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Sweet, precious, beautiful Liv Tyler. You thought you'd lost her forever, just like Bruce Willis did when he blew himself up with a nuclear bomb in the center of an asteroid the size of Texas. His heroism and fatherly pride were ALSO the size of Texas.
<br />

<br />
But your love for Liv is not fatherly, oh no. This reunion is with no loving daughter, but a loving movie star fantasy crush, who happens to be in the form of a robot bunny which has traveled through time, and been given as a gift on five separate occasions, twice by you and thrice to you, and originally fished out of a sewer by Nicholas Cage on the silver screen. 
<br />

 <b> 03/22/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005570">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 03/22/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005571">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This tiny hammer is so ridiculous! It's too bad it is not the right size. You would love to wallop some imps with such a fanciful weapon. 
<br />

<br />
You guess you could just go around giving them little bops on the head with it. Like a silly gavel. No, that would be too absurd, even for a great prankster like you. You will discard this rubbish immediately.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/22/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005574">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 03/22/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005575">"John: Read note."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">John!!! One more thing...
<br />

<br />
This rabbit im sure youve noticed is armed to the stitches! Hes got all four of the funny little weapons i mentioned thatre all deadly as the fucking dickens but that doesnt mean they are meant exclusively for the paws of mr terry kiser. (That is the name i call him.) Heck no.
<br />

<br />
You see i adapted terry with some doodads you may deem practical. An infinitesimalator which i used to littlefy them down in the first place as well as a monstrositifier for when you would like to hugen them up and wield them yourself! Hes surely got enough juice in him to make them enormous if you wish. But thats silly what would you even do with say a magic needle the size of a skyscraper for instance? Preposterous! 
<br />

<br />
I borrowed this technology from my grandmother who had quite the way with manipulating space. Legend tells she was something of a witch with the stuff! Once she was a brave hero like you and i john and the stars themselves twinkled in her cauldron. I would like to tell you who my grandmother is i really would. But i cant. I think i have trouble keeping secrets. I like to be honest just like you and a lot of secrecy after a while gets me feeling a bit jaded. Heh heh.

Green means grow red means shrink! See you soon pal.

 <b> 03/24/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005580">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are so delighted by your rad new hammer and the cool hugening abilities of Liv Tyler or Terry Kiser or whatever her/his name is. Who the hell is Terry Kiser, anyway? Probably a movie star from the future. Who cares though, your bunny will be LIV 4 LYFE &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 HEARTS HEARTS HEARTS
<br />

<br />
You wonder what other neat things you can get Liv to monstrositify with her sweet eye beams?<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/24/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005581">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Wait, what happened to her green eye? And why is she feverishly gesticulating toward the fellow in the ghost sheets? This is so ridiculous, you cannot turn your back on these people to admire a beautiful hammer for even one moment.
<br />

<br />
You think that is enough fooling around. It is time to get down to business again. The serious business of being an important and heroic leader.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/24/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005582">"John: Wear the hood. Be the leader."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are not their leader, you are their FRIEND, there is a BIG difference!
<br />

<br />
You prepare to issue your party a highly authoritative series of FRIENDLY REQUESTS.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/24/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005583">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
First you request that everyone settle down! The squat fellow mediates between the two bickering parties, and patches up Liv's missing eye. She is nothing if not accustomed to decades of repair work, and quickly resumes her plucky demeanor.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/24/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005584">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You then in your most leaderly way ask Liv to pilot that enormous battleship! She will now be known as Captain Tyler.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/24/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005585">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
She littlefies the ship down to something more manageable for a small bunny captain. Everyone is impressed.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/24/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005586">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You give your wallet to your loyal chauffeur familiar. He looks puzzled. You inform the party that you will not be going on this journey. You must remain behind and continue looking for your father.
<br />

<br />
But you insist their mission is the most critical of all! You know they can handle it. You believe in them.
<br />

<br />
You instruct Captain Tyler to set a course for the ship's home. They must fly to Derse, and deliver the Tumor to the moon. Everyone salutes their intrepid friendleader. This is what teamwork is all about.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/24/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005587">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And this guy...
<br />

<br />
You guess this guy can go along and help out?
<br />

<br />
Hey who even is this guy, anyway? You guess it doesn't matter. He seems nice enough.<br><br><br>
 <b> 03/25/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005588">"John: Bid farewell."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Godspeed, heroes. You have all the faith in the world that they will be successful. 
<br />

<br />
As a friendleader, or sometimes known as a palhoncho, you have done an amazing job. You have come up with a plan, and politely requestordered your loyal team to execute it. It is all falling into place perfectly. You are quite sure you have not failed to account for even a single thing.<br><br><br>

<br />
You have no idea what the hell this thing is, or why you would need another disc. 
<br />

<br />
You just captchalogue it and proceed. There is justice to be done, and you are running out of time.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/16/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005617">"[S] Terezi: Proceed."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You cannot wake up, because you were not actually asleep! You were just taking a breather in this nice cozy pile of horrifically mutilated scalemates, which were gathered here to break your fall for some reason. 
<br />

<br />
You wonder where you are? This is a fancy looking room. It doesn't look like a place you would expect to find on this meteor, at least not in any strictly canonical capacity.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/18/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005620">"Terezi: Examine surroundings."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This dapper kiwi-suited gentleman is quite familiar. You are almost positive he made an appearance in that very crowded dream you had recently...
<br />

<br />
Where did he go??
<br />

<br />

 <b> 04/18/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005622">"Terezi: Exit door."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The door is locked!
<br />

<br />
You will either need a key, or to break it down with force. You would need to achieve an especially heightened state of determination to pull that off, though.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/18/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005623">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You have been completely hornswoggled. This whole thing was a setup from the start. A trap deployed by a cunning mastermind. All of the clues are adding up. The blood. The note. The flagrant displays of tricksterism and japery. The identity of the puppetmaster behind all of this is now painfully obvious to you.<br><br><br>

 <b> 04/19/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005625">"[S] Terezi: Play records."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You select appropriate crime solving music to set the right mood. With this kind of atmosphere, it is highly unlikely that any crime will stay unsolved for long.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/19/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005626">"Terezi: Remove Midnight Crew record."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
No no, this vaudevillian cornball nonsense will not do at all. The mood is just not right for figuring out crimes.
<br />

<br />
You put the record back in its sleeve.<br><br><br>

<br />
Before you can make heads or tails of who exactly this douche bag is, something rolls out of the sleeve. It appears to be a very small record. It's so small! What is such a small record doing in this great big sleeve?<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/20/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005629">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You cannot get over how tiny this record is. It's adorable. You wonder what sort of music it plays?<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/20/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005630">"[S] Terezi: Play tiny record."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Predictably, you scratch the surface of the disc. What were you expecting? It's almost like you don't even know what a CD is.
<br />

<br />
With the disc damaged, who knows what sort of effects it will have on the data. Better store it somewhere safe to prevent any more mishaps.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/20/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005632">"Terezi: Captchalogue disc."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It should be perfectly safe from any similar kinds of damage while secured in your SCRATCH AND SNIFF modus.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/21/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005633">"Terezi: Examine chests."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You have spent way too much time calibrating the ambiance of your investigation, and not nearly enough time investigating. It is one of the most common pitfalls to being an investigator. Aside from literal pitfalls, which you actually fall into.
<br />

<br />
There are two chests in this secret room. Nothing out of the ordinary. Chests are everywhere in this lab, and people find it all too tempting to sneak their personal belongings into them for safe keeping. That is, until the goods are stolen shortly after by those who can't resist looting every chest they encounter, which is everybody.
<br />

<br />
Maybe these ones contain clues?<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/21/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005634">"Terezi: Open chest."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You got your NEOPHYTE REDGLARE ROLEPLAYING OUTFIT!
<br />

<br />
What is this doing in here? You have not worn it since your Flarping days. The only part of it you kept on hand was the stylish pair of glasses, which of course since the incident has managed to become a regular accessory.
<br />

<br />
But you cannot imagine how someone could have gotten their hands on the rest of it. Surely a crafty and resourceful criminal is at work. 
<br />

 <b> 04/21/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005635">"Terezi: Wear suit."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You don the garb of the legendary legislacerator. It brings back memories of many successful fantasy prosecutions resulting in the real executions of rival players. Those were the days.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/21/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005636">"Terezi: Open other chest."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You got your PYRALSPITE PLUSH!
<br />

<br />
Pyralspite was your scalemate sidekick during your campaigns. He was the model of loyalty, friendship, and righteous retribution. More than could be said for another partner in justice.
<br />

<br />
There is no doubt about it anymore. She is clearly baiting you into confrontation.
<br />

<br />
You mean 88ing.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/21/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005637">"Terezi: Hug Pyralspite."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You embrace your old friend releasing a mighty and majestic squeak. It has been too long, old friend. You vow never to let him out of your scent agai.........................<br><br><br>

<br />
This puppet is becoming a nuisance. It appears to exhibit the same incredible puppet fastness properties which Dave's had. Must be some form of universal puppet enchantment. It couldn't possibly be the same one, because that would just be insane.
<br />

<br />
Hey, where did Pyralspite go???<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/23/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005640">"Terezi: Look up."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
There he is. How'd he get all the way up there? He has always been quite the slippery scalawag.
<br />

<br />
Maybe he was reminding you to check out the note. You almost forgot is was up there, what with all your furious investigating. Most of which has involved fooling around with records, hugging plush toys and cosplaying as a childhood heroine.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/23/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005641">"Terezi: Read it."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Just as you thought. It is a message from Vriska summoning you to do battle. It is written in Gamzee's rich jelly-smelling blood, but it is her handwriting for sure. Her quirk is present, leaving the matter unde88a8le.
<br />

<br />
But why the hell does she want you to bring this stupid puppet along? She's so weird.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
I now do so in captivity, while I 8ring my awe to 8ear on the immensity of the Su8juggl8or's high jinx. I took their gesture as plain avowal of my prosecution's futility. With a lone neophyte assigned to the task, how could I view it otherwise? I was sure they'd drawn from the 8ottom of their deck, not intending to squander more competent mercenaries on one who'd made a show of outclassing them all 8efore. 8ut I discovered too l8 that Redglare was their wild card all along.
<br />

<br />
How is one allowed to 8e raised 8y a dragon in this era? Let alone one of such middling 8lood, the sickly hue of a gutless civil servant. Those of her caste are typically pleased to mount a sluggish choler8ear, or some 8rainless squawking spleenfowl during petty expeditions to plaster seizure notices on gam8lignant property. 8y what fluke was this woman granted such a weapon, permitting her to luxuri8 in these delusions of righteousness? 
<br />

<br />
Something 8locked the light of the un8itten moon, treating the har8or to darkness more grim than what fell this season's apogee. I made the mistake of looking into its eyes, each like a sun concentr8ted into a small jewel, as two hot garnets searing through a 8lack veil. I shut mine quickly, 8ut the more sensitive of them was 8urned irrepara8ly. When I regained sight in the other, there was only red. My fleet was in flames. The neophyte was on deck. Pyralspite, she mentioned through her ridiculous forced grin. She wanted me to know the name of the 8east which was a8le to consume my lusus whole.
<br />

<br />
My dice were in the hold 8elow, not that my present luck would consent to a favora8le roll anyway. I made a move for my 8lade. She took my arm, which I'm sure she kept as the tiniest of snacks for her ostent8ious custodian. May8e she meant to prove she wouldn't need me in irons to have my su8mission?

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">I cradled the oracle in my synthetic hand, as if appraising 8y w8 the mystic qualities it still concealed. With my vision 8fold seared away, I was as 8lind to its secrets as the old Doctor was to its present wherea8outs. I'd learned to keep it cloaked from the awareness of the man who once called me his protege, a 8ackhanded term of endearment from a smug manipul8or. Loc8ing his so called dark pockets was the only gam8it I had in countering his milktongued dou8lespeak. The expatri8 for indiscerni8le reasons seemed naturally surrounded 8y such a void in the Doctor's awareness, and so was uniquely fit to inherit the or8. The Doctor could not see his treasure, nor I into it. 
<br />

<br />
I considered what to do with it for a while. Should I find Pyralspite 8y consulting with the oracle, as I'd done so often to steal fortune from my adversaries? I guessed exploiting some technological means of gazing through its surface may have 8een simple enough, 8ut I hesit8ed. Every expedient granted 8y its counsel, though never instantly, came at a price. Knowing his n8ture, I'm surprised I only now recognize it as yet another instrument of his spurious 8enevolence, dangerous 8y way of selective divulgence. The sense of infalli8ility his oracle 8rought me was superficial, and in hindsight weakened my readiness. Knowing my f8 so far in advance, I took Redglare's threat lightly. The gr8est mistake I have ever made was asking the or8 when I would die. 
<br />

<br />
8ut as I revisited the prophecy surrounding this unfortun8 query, something struck me. I thought of the man I would have as a m8sprit centuries from now, who was said to command an army of 8easts. The one it called the summoner.</span><br><br><br>
 <b> 05/05/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005658">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">If my o8session with the dragon should continue to 8urn for so long, would he 8e the one to assist me in taming it? I did not have enough knowledge to ask the right questions when I had the opportunity. Were that the case, I might have asked if it would 8e his rare a8ilities of communion that would 8ring Pyralspite under control. Would it 8e on account of my influence? And if so, would I exert this influence 8y taking his will, or winning his heart? These are details I would have given no second thought in drawing from the or8, my curiosity a force usually too much to quell. 8ut now...
<br />

<br />
I have thought of the summoner often. I have 8een trou8led to know that as one so common 8looded, he could not possi8ly have hatched yet, nor will he wriggle from the caverns for many sweeps. So I must have p8tience to take up my role in his story of heroism. It is a tale which reads to me as though lifted from a child's story, yet I know I'd 8e a fool to dou8t its veracity entirely. He would rise through the ranks of the cavalreapers and assume command, having proven the most skilled and fearless of them. He would exhi8it a remarka8le pup8tion, the sort only recorded in myth, growing, or perhaps simply revealing, a striking pair of wings. His army thus inspired would spearhead a major re8ellion. Surely one at least on the scale of the sectarian revolt crushed 8y the High8loods, who thereafter for8ade its mention, or any invoc8tion of the heretical sym69ls at all, even in private journals. Which is why I will stick to the fa8le of the summoner, and not risk another execution with even o8lique reference to the compelling tale of the sufferer. 
<br />

<br />
Resolution to the summoner's mutiny is foggy, as I only understand what has 8een rel8ed to me through the 8rief answers I thought to solicit. Ultim8ely, the ire of the Condesce would 8e such that in the settling dust of the conflict, she would 8anish all from the homeworld, except the young. She would scatter all who reached maturity to the stars to fight her wars, I presume to keep them occupied, existing in a less centralized st8 from which such a coup may arise. This is still an incredi8le notion for me to consider, and I cannot imagine how she would come to enforce such an upheaval in our civiliz8tion. Though I suppose she will have on her side the advantage of an unparalleled lifespan, and the leverage extended 8y the hideous psychic prongs of her deep undul8ing monstrosity. That is, until it chooses another little witch to serve. Nevertheless, I take the prediction as truth, and find it amusing that a homeworld domin8ed 8y children will 8e the gr8 summoner's legacy. One of them, at least.
<br />

<br />
More importantly, and less amusingly, his legacy will 8e my demise. You see, I first learned his name when I asked who would 8e the one to kill me.</span><br><br><br>

<span style="color: #005682">I have never spoken nor written of him out of contempt for the prophecy, 8ut do so here, in my final entry for this journal. I took this to 8e a pitia8le fate, and scoured the or8 for any means of escaping it, or at least, to salvage a little dignity from the tale of my downfall. Alas, it had no consol8tion for my vanity.
<br />

<br />
8ut as I sit here deciding what to do with the damna8le little sphere, I understand my error. It was not in failing to chart a course through future events to turn my fortune's tide, even so many sweeps from now. It was in 8elieving the future was mine to know, and fortune mine to control. If this hero is meant to 8reathe life into my em8ittered heart, and if he is to earn the right to run it through, then so 8e it. For him, I will commit to this page my highest expect8tions.

 <b> 05/16/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005668">"[o] Tock."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Never mind, I figured it out instantly because of my unfathomable intellect, limitless knowledge, and mind boggling charisma. Granted, my charisma had less to do with it than the other qualities. But it didn't hurt, did it?
<br />

Here, I'll show you.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/16/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005669">"[o] Tick."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The Seer of Mind had challenged the Thief of Light to a simple game of chance. 
<br />

<br />
If the result was the undamaged side, the Thief would agree to stay. If not, she would &quot;go.&quot;<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/16/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005670">"[o] Tock."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The result of the flip was left inconclusive, at which point you decided to pay me a visit. 
<br />

<br />
But the inconclusive should not be confused with the uncertain. The actual result was trivial; it was a constant across all timelines.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/16/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005671">"[o] Both the Seer and the Thief knew this."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The Thief used her abilities to steal the fortune of her opponent, and forced the flip to yield what she regarded as the most favorable outcome. The Seer anticipated this move, correctly.
<br />

<br />
This is why I don't care much for gambling. While a sucker is born with each tick of the clock, a cheater is born with each tock betwixt.
<br />

<br />
Also, because it is boring, and I am already a very wealthy man.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/18/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005672">"[o] Tick."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The Seer relayed her terms through the generally understood argot of an assassin. The result &quot;go,&quot; while at face value would suggest the Thief was allowed to leave, was actually the Seer's code word for the threat of death. This was obvious to everyone, including the Thief.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/18/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005673">"[o] Tock."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
While the Thief turned to fly away, making a show of claiming her prize, the Seer would stab her in the back the moment her guard was dropped. This was her plan. Not a particularly clever tactic in its own right, but its ingenuity didn't dwell in the novelty of the ruse, nor even the neutralized probabilities in the game of chance. Psychology was in play.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/18/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005674">"[o] Tick."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Naturally, the Thief knew this was her intent all along. She knew the Seer would have understood the outcome to be rigged, and that she likely intended to kill her as a consequence of the fixed result. This was to be seen as an implicit dare to the Thief to allow the flip to fall fairly, something which the Seer knew the Thief's ego wouldn't allow.
<br />

<br />
And the Seer knew the Thief knew all this as well. 
<br />

<br />
Just another pair of cheaters attempting to play with their cards face up. Amateurs.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/18/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005675">"[o] Tock."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Each was gambling, not with any vehicle of probability, which had been eliminated from the equation, but with each other's intentions. The Thief indeed took the Seer's bait, stealing the luck needed to affect the flip in defiance of her dare. And in turning to leave, she then posed a dare of her own to the Seer, challenging her to back up the implied threat.
<br />

<br />
This was the Thief's gamble. She wagered the Seer would not be able to go through with it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/18/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005676">"[o] It turned out,"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
She was right.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/18/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005677">"[o] So ends a tale of rivalry."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Well, almost. There's a bit more.
<br />

<br />
But in order to understand its proper conclusion, we should first catch up with another of my other proteges, from whom I'm expecting a message shortly. 
<br />

<br />
The other Seer. 
<br />

<br />

It would be disingenuous of me to present it as such, and I will not belittle your intelligence with such a tawdry narrative ploy. It would be rude, and I am too well dressed for that kind of behavior.
<br />

<br />
If there truly stood some chance of permanence to the Heir's corpsehood, I can hear you asking now...<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/25/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005690">"[o] How could this moment later come to pass?"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And for that matter, what sort of story would this be, with our human Hero of Breath made to stay a cadaver? Definitely not one the alpha timeline would allow.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/25/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005691">"[o] And what sort of spectator would you be..."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
If you'd forgotten the terms ruling the conditional immortality he won with his previous, similarly unceremonious impaling?<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/25/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005692">"[o] He'd done nothing to earn martyrdom,"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
By which we might laud his fall as heroic.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/25/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005693">"[o] Nor had he tasted notoriety,"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
To secure a death one may parse just.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/26/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005694">"[o] And while I can't give you my assurance,"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
I'm reasonably convinced of this much. When the Hero of Breath dies for good, it won't be as a scoundrel.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/26/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005695">"[o] But not for lack of a devoted mentor."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
If I had served as his mentor directly, rather than as his mentor's mentor's mentor, he may have stood a fair chance of perpetrating something underhanded. At the very least, his jokes might have been better.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/26/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005696">"[o] Instead, he got her."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The other Hero of Light. Always bugging him.
<br />

<br />
Bugging and fussing and meddling.
<br />

<br />
What's her deal?<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/27/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005697">"[o] Let's find out."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
I mentioned there was a bit more to her story. I believe it's time to resume it.
<br />

<br />
I trust you won't mind if I step away for a moment. I have important guests arriving very soon. If you need me, I'll be up here, making sure everything is in order, which it already is, and keeping an eye, which I don't have, on the clock, which I don't need.<br><br><br>

Apologies for my preoccupation. I have managed to pacify the rowdier of my two other guests with sugary little black dogs, so that I may continue my narration. But only briefly. In a moment, I will go stand over by my typewriter and teach my neophyte protege the consequences for taking advice from strange men over the internet, while I continue to attend to my second guest, who is you from an earlier point in the story.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/31/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005709">"[o] Remember?"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
We met here in my apartment a little while ago. At that moment, I was busy hosting you from the future, who is you right now, but I did not mention this at the time. I would have introduced your past self to your future self and vice versa, but it is a well known fact that past and future selves tend not to get along. A good host would never tolerate the potential for discord among guests, and as hosts go, I am simply the best there is. 
<br />

<br />
Please don't be alarmed. Past you was just leaving.
<br />

<br />
Where was I?<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/31/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005710">"[o] Of course."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The two Heroes of Light had challenged the same Jack Noir, the one straddling The Scratch and about twenty hours of his own time, to a circumstantially simultaneous pair of duels. Circumstantial simultaneity is a concept more complex than its temporal analogue, and is valuable for examining the properties of paradox space. It is the agent responsible for the major cosmic event which pre-extinction Alternians came to refer to as The Great Undoing. The same concept rules the innumerable lesser events by which this critical moment shall be catalyzed, including the break, my employer's arrival, the detonation of a very powerful bomb, and my own death. It is an abstraction weaving together the fortunes of otherwise perfectly disparate chronologies, such as those bound to a pair of distinct sessions. It's not fully comprehensible to a mortal mind, and the length I will go to explain it to you will not extend beyond this sentence.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/31/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005711">"[o] But the story will."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The Slayer was, for the moment, unmotivated by the Thief's motion for a compelling duel. This side of The Scratch, he opted for a more ruthless and calculating policy of extermination. On his arrival, not about to repeat the mistakes leading to his banishment, he quickly obliterated all twelve planets, followed by Prospit and Derse, to weed out those who might outsmart him in the same manner. 
<br />

<br />
With as little fanfare, he seized the opportunity to follow the Thief's trail quickly before it dissipated, and destroyed their hideout in the veil.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/01/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005712">"[o] And now knowing her position,"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
He would soon return for the duel she wanted.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/01/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005713">"[o] But not without a pair of trophies."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/01/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005714">"[o] Tick."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/01/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005715">"[o] Tock."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Again, sorry for the interruption. My conversation with the girl ran a bit long, slightly exceeding the one second I scheduled for it.
<br />

<br />
This is where events begin to outpace my awareness. The deeper into this dark pocket we explore, the more I will be forced to speculate. I rarely have cause to rely on probability, but luckily for you, my guesses are better than anybody's.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/01/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005716">"[o] Tick."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
I have always believed that a good storyteller should keep a comprehensive record of past events on hand. A scrapbook of personal significance, for instance, from which he may piece together current moments from past ones of a similar, if not identical nature. It's more efficient.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/01/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005717">"[o] Tock."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It's also logical, since there is essentially nothing new in paradox space. Everything that can happen is either a visual or substantive reproduction of something which has already transpired on a timeline, offshoot or otherwise.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/02/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005718">"[o] Tick."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And if I'm going speculate on this duel, I might as well make use of earlier clippings. 
<br />

<br />
For the Slayer, this was round one against the Hero of Light.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/02/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005719">"[o] Tock."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
All I really need to do is flip it turn-ways, like so, and we have...<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/02/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005720">"[o] Round two."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/exclamation.gif" border="0" /><br><br><br>
 <b> 06/02/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005721">"[o] The Thief would probably roll her dice."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And just as probably, due to her impressive hoard of stolen fortune, she would have a 100% chance of rolling the most favorable result.
<br />

<br />
Ordinarily, this result would be almost impossibly improbable. The odds of the roll would be 1 in 16,777,216, to be specific. 
<br />

<br />
And to be less specific, 1 in...<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/02/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005722">"[o] 8^y"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Where y = 8.
<br />

<br />
[<span style="color: #0e4603">Hee hee.</span>]<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/04/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005723">"[o] Tick."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/04/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005724">"[o] Tock."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/04/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005725">"[o] Tick."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/04/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005726">"[o] Tock."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/08/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005727">"[o] In round two, the Slayer would be not merely compelled,"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
But challenged, if my guess is right. 
<br />

<br />
Challenged by one claiming godhood before reaping the prodigious spoils from striking down a formidable endgame foe. One with the guile of a cheater, the luck of a <span style="color: #2ed73a">Clover</span>, the hubris of her mentor, and the drive known only to the pathologically competitive.
<br />

<br />
I believe he'd be challenged, yes...<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/08/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005728">"[o] Tick."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
But not outmatched. 
<br />

<br />
As one who shares the Slayer's source of power, my projection must give him the unambiguous advantage. But even so...<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/08/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005729">"[o] While I continue to not be a gambling man,"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
(That didn't stop being a thing that was true or anything.)<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/08/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005730">"[o] Tock."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
I'm reasonably sure that if I was,<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/08/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005731">"[o] I wouldn't bet against her."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/08/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005732">"[o] Moving on."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Let's pull back from this ever narrowing dark pocket. All this uncertainty is wearing thinner than the only pair of pants in an immortal's wardrobe.
<br />

<br />
I've never much enjoyed navigating the vortices of alternative possibility. The path which alone has my absolute mastery is the alpha timeline, a continuum I define as that which boasts exclusive rights both to my birth and to my death, two circumstantially simultaneous events. Any divergence from this path to my knowing will taper into blackness like rotting roots. But if I was a Seer, such offshoots would be fully within my domain. And if I was a Seer of Mind in particular, synaptic causality would be my specialty. 
<br />

<br />
A Seer of Mind would have given you a more reliable account, perhaps. But then, she would do many things I wouldn't.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/08/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005733">"[o] Tick."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
A Seer would support her allies in battle not with her weapons, but her vision. She would sift through dross of her comrades' poor tactical inclinations and examine the grim consequences. A Seer would not charge into the fray headlong but direct it as a conductor with a baton. She would have the sight to eschew the obvious gambits, and find the path to victory disguised cleverly as setback, or even imminent defeat. She would behold the fortunes of friends and foes in totality, and appraise the contrivance of luck itself. She would know its mines were not to be plundered, but simply explored and charted carefully.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/08/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005734">"[o] Tock."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
A true Seer would know where luck is a given, where it is absent, and most importantly, where it doesn't matter at all.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/08/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005735">"[o] Tick."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And she would know victory doesn't matter in a reality where all else is doomed to fail.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/08/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005736">"[o] Tock."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
What sort of story would this be, with our Knight and Seer made to stay cadavers? Certainly not one the alpha timeline would allow.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/08/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005737">"[o] Tick."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And not one she'd allow either.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/08/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005738">"[o] Tock."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: HELL IF I KNOW, THIS IS BASICALLY DREAM INTELLIGENCE, EVERY TIME SHE GOES TO SLEEP, SHE HAS MORE TO RAMBLE ABOUT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SHE SAYS I SHOULD GO TO SLEEP TO FIND OUT, BUT I'M LIKE HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO BE NAPPING BETWEEN MAKING ALL THESE PLANS AND GETTING PERSECUTED BY THIS DEMENTED HONKING ASSHOLE?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SO YEAH, WE'LL MEET IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE EXPLOSION WITH OUR PEOPLE ON THE INSIDE, OR I GUESS I SHOULD SAY OUTSIDE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I DON'T THINK THEY CAN COME WITH US THOUGH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: come with you where? who are they?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: DEAD PEOPLE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: AS FOR WHERE, IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE GOING TO STICK AROUND THERE FOREVER. THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE DEPRESSING, SINCE WE'RE NOT FUCKING GHOSTS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: THE SCRATCH WILL REBOOT YOUR SESSION. YOUR WHOLE UNIVERSE ACTUALLY. SO SOMEWHERE IN THIS DREADFUL ABYSS, THAT NEW SESSION WILL START UP IN ITS OWN INCIPISPHERE, FROM SCRATCH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: LOOK AT THAT, ANOTHER PUN BECAUSE OF USING THAT FUCKING WORD EVERY OTHER SENTENCE! KILL ME NOW.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BUT THAT &quot;FROM SCRATCH&quot; (F'ING LOL!) SESSION IS WHAT YOU'RE SHOOTING FOR TO SURVIVE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: THE IDEA IS FOR YOU ALL TO PRESERVE YOURSELVES BY ESCAPING THERE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: through the lawn ring?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YES.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: ONCE YOU'RE THERE, YOU WILL HELP US FIND OUR WAY THERE TOO, AND THEN WE CAN ALL FINALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT THE FUCK TO DO WITH THE REST OF OUR LIVES.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: so then, this is how we're supposed to meet. that is kind of exciting.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YEAH, I GUESS, IF ENOUGH OF US ARE ALIVE BY THEN TO MEET.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: so, i guess you are not worried about it turning into a huge sloppy makeout fest anymore...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: UH</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: RIGHT! HAHAHA, JOHN, YOU AND VRISKA BETTER KEEP YOUR HANDS TO YOURSELVES, OR EVERYONE'S GOING TO BE REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE. NO INTERSPECIES FUNNYBUSINESS, IS THAT CLEAR!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BLAAAAAAARGH, I AM CONVINCINGLY FLIPPING MY LID ABOUT THIS, WAVING MY ARMS AROUND A LOT, AND MAKING ALL MY BEST YELLING FACES. WOW, LOOK AT THAT! IT'S TIME TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT AGAIN.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: huh?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: POOF! SUBJECT CHANGED.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IF IT WORKS AND YOU WIND UP IN THE NEW SESSION, THAT'S WHY IT'LL BE IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE ONE OF THE DERSE DREAMERS STAYS WITH YOU, SO THEY CAN HELP GUIDE US THERE FROM THE RING.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: won't there be other players in the new session?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: like, alternate universe versions of ourselves or such?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: PROBABLY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: BUT THOSE CHUMPS WON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT US, OR ALL OUR PLANS. WHY WOULD THEY?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: yeah... it's just kind of a weird thought.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: SO OUT OF EVERYTHING WE JUST TALKED ABOUT, THIS IS THE THING THAT HAS YOU TRIPPING GLOBES? WHATEVER YOU SAY!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: but i guess it's sort of comforting too.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: if rose or dave have to go off and die, at least i get to see them again, in a way.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: even if i will only be alternate universe john to them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: maybe my dad will be alive in that session too!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: OK, MAYBE, BUT BEFORE YOU GET TOO EXCITED ABOUT THAT, YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET THERE FIRST.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT I SAY, AND STICK TO THE PLAN.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON GETTING READY TO START THE SCRATCH. THE GAME DOESN'T MAKE A HARD RESET THAT EASY TO PULL OFF.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: ONCE YOU INITIATE IT, THE GAME THROWS EVERYTHING IT'S GOT AT YOU. WHICH IS ONE REASON WHY YOU'RE THE BEST GUY FOR THE JOB, BECAUSE OF YOUR SUPERPOWERS AND SILLY WINDY BULLSHIT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ok. i'll do my best.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: what should i do right now?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: GET PREPARED, MAKE ALL THE EQUIPMENT YOU THINK YOU'LL NEED, STAY OUT OF TROUBLE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: WAIT FOR JADE TO SEND THAT CODE, WAIT FOR ME TO CONTACT YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND DO YOUR BEST TO HUMOR HIM WHILE HE IGNORANTLY ATTEMPTS TO FLAME YOU BACK INTO THE PUDDLE OF SLIME YOU CRAWLED OUT OF.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: PLEASE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: oh, man.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: our &quot;first&quot; conversation ever? i can't wait.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: YEAH, BUT CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING IN MY DEFENSE BEFORE THAT HAPPENS?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: I DON'T ACTUALLY HATE YOU, AND I NEVER DID. I WAS DELUDING MYSELF.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: DEEP DOWN I'M SURE I WAS ALWAYS PRETTY OK WITH YOU.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: thanks karkat!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">CG: IT WASN'T A FUCKING COMPLIMENT.</span><br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: You mean a canard of behemothic embellishment?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Or was your resolve finally dismantled by the siren's song of all that flame broiled beef?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: no no</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: ok first do you even have burger kings out in the fucking woods</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: why do you reference things that obviously arent in the woods like terrible burgers</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'll limit my establishments of reference to lumber mills and sugar shanties from now on.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Also, there's a Burger King less than forty minutes from my house. I won't let this stand in the way of the new policy though.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: there is</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: ok whatever</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: im talking about a dream i just had</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i mean it was a doozy like psychologically speaking</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: doozy is a slightly dumber word than whopper</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Certainly less delicious.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: it was absurdly heavy handed my subconscious was really slathering it on</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: like whatever tangy sludge the king himself squirts on his bargain patties</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: its possible that i dreamt it ironically i dunno</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i figured youd be interested in hearing about it its every bit as thick and juicy as a half pound of sizzling grade A premium ok this is stupid weve got to get burgers out of this conversation</span>

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I thought you didn't want me to analyze your dreams anymore.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: no but this one is too good not to put under the microscope with your whole precocious psychotherapy shtick its almost laughably symbolic of all my mental problems assuming i actually have those</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: its grotesquely pregnant with meaning</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: all gestating at least 8 gooey octuplets thrashing around in an undulating belly full of mind slime</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Maybe we can start by evaluating that troubling metaphor.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: no look</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i just want your professional take on how many things in my dream symbolize dicks</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: We've already established that all of your dreams are packed with enough homoerotic symbolism to lift Freudian theory from the ashes of discreditation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: yeah thats a given but i didnt even dream about puppets this time</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Are you serious?</span>

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Go on.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i was in this dark place surrounded by this big flock of crows</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: god this is so generically morbid</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: im sorry in advance for exposing you to my unconscious minds retarded cliches</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: They wouldn't be cliches if they didn't comprise the unanimously understood bedrock of phallic symbolism, with no other viable interpretation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: well obviously i knew the birds were just black screaming sky dongs just hear me out</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i kept dying</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: there kept being these traps like i would go one way and get my head chopped off</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: or go another way and get stabbed or whatever</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and every time i died the dream reset itself and i was standing there alive and ready to try to escape again</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: but each time i would be watching myself from the vantage point of a different crow</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: like i was the crow all squawking around in circles like a macabre flapping douche</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and i would always watch myself try to do something different to dodge the trap but i always ended up dead</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Hm.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Well, if I've learned anything from my extensive skimming over the Wikipedia articles on dream analysis,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's that this dream is very unlikely to have any literal significance whatsoever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's probably not about dying at all.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: you mean maybe its about anxiety over maintaining my blogs</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: or that my beats might not be ill enough</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Yes. In fact, if you were on my couch that would have been my next question, as a licensed professional.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: &quot;Mr. Strider, have you considered that what you actually dread is to have your urban rhythms exposed for what they truly are, which is, clinically speaking, just shy of 'da bomb'?&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and then we crack up laughing cause we both know theyre fresher than your moms change of drawers and tighter than when shes wearin them</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Listening to you conjure imagery of my mother in her underpants is definitely keeping us buoyed high above this swirling Freudian hellhole.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Well done.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: please its not like shes my mom i can visualize her choice ass all i want without it gettin much more than moderately uncomfortable for everyone involved</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: What if you're wrong?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: about what</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Her not being your mother.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: uh</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Don't worry, you're probably safe. Luckily I can think of no literary or historical precedent for that sort of folly whatsoever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: this isnt the first time youve insinuated were related what is up with that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Isn't it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: no</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i mean</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: im not sure</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i feel like youve brought it up before which is kind of weird but now i dont know</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i think im getting this weird deja vu thing where i was sure we talked about this</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: forget it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Why don't you tell me more about your dream?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: ok</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: so i kept dying and kept being crows and stuff</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and then i started to notice something coming from the sky</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: it was this faint eerie singing and i look up and theres nothing there just darkness</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That's interesting.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I've read about this.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what did you read</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Certain texts say singing from the unknowable void carries a message.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That its recipient has been selected for a mission of supreme cosmic importance, that will result in your death and that of billions more.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: But one that is essential to the perpetuation of existence itself.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what the fuck sort of crackpot psychology text would say something like that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's not from a psychology text.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: so then youre consulting astrology books now</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Not astrology.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: More like,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Zoology.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: oh my fucking god will you put that away</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Keep describing the dream, though.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: If the rest of it is incompatible with prognoses of the zoologically dubious, I will withdraw my insinuation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: theres not even much more to it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i looked up into the sky</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: didnt see anyone singing</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: but even though the sky was black i could see the sun</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: it was bright as hell even through my shades</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: so i flapped my wings and flew up away to it like a fucking piece of garbage</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and thats it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: This doesn't strike you as an impulse of self destruction?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: no</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: not in the sense that it was a dark sacrificial zoology mission</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: it was more like somewhere to go besides watching myself die a lot from the vantage of a feathery murder of dumb shitty birds</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: So, if hypothetically you were to accept such a mission, or even insist upon one, it wouldn't be in the spirit of genuine sacrifice, but of escape?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: what the fuck are you talking about</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: ok somethings wrong</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: this whole conversation is falling apart this isnt how it originally went at all</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Aw. We were making good progress, too.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Why did you have to go and remember?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: this happened months ago</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: does this mean im dead</span><br><br><br>

<span style="color: #005682">AG: Calm down, I just thought I would foreshadow my existence to you at this quaint moment on your timeline.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It is way too tempting not to let you know I have taken gr8 care to 8ecome a very important feature of your life.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Or for that matter, to let you know that I will 8e giving you a present so much 8etter than the useless crap you're shoving in that 8ox.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I will 8e giving you the gift of immortality!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: oh sweet, that has been on my wish list, ranking just below a mint condition little monsters poster, starring hollywood superstar, howie mandel.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: can i expect it to arrive on my next birthday??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yes, as a matter of fact. Nice guess!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It will come at a cost though.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: the mandel poster, or immortality?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: The latter, jackass!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: In order for you to claim it, you will have to 8e quite gulli8le and allow me to arrange your murder.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: i see, here is where all the sick trolling begins!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: you can keep your present, i am not interested.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut you will 8e! You will happily go along with everything I tell you to do.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: And then, once I have completely earned your trust, I will kill you John. ::::)</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: sigh...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: the other troll i just talked to was way better, if a tad grumpy, at least she was down with talking about cool movies, sort of.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut this is all true. I've seen it already. You have no idea how delicious the dramatic irony is right now!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: You will die. I will lead you into a trap, and watch you 8leed to death on a 8ig stone sla8 with a sword stuck in your chest.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: There is nothing you can do a8out it. In fact, it has already happened!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: that's nice. now scram, troll!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I'll leave you alone soon enough.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I was just feeling pretty pleased with myself, a8out all the 8rilliant plans I made for you and your friends.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Stopping 8y in your past to mess with your head is really just a courtesy, 8ecause I like to think we're pretty good friends 8y the time I get around to killing you. ::::D</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: ok, you got me!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: my feathers are all ruffled, and i can no longer tell my ass apart from a big orange earth vegetable!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: now can you leave me alone?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I guess so.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut my inevita8le grisly murder of you notwithstanding, you're a pretty fun guy to hassle. It'll 8e difficult sparing you from the privilege of my company until your game 8egins.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: that is basically the worst pickup line i have ever heard.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Please, John. As if there is any conceiva8le sequence of events which could lead me to consider you as a via8le romantic partner, in any quadrant. Even the pale ones.</span>

<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yeah, I figured. Just as well. I made some pretty em8arrassing confessions to you.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; i mean happens to you after this, heheh, that one was kind of obtuse, sorry</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Whats a timeline? :3</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; hmmmmmm thats a hard question</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; ok imagine a long tempting strand of yarn</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Yes! Oh yes so great.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; now imagine instead of being made of wiggly enticing stuff, its made of what lets you exist</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; and you are right at the twitching tip of it, dont you s33? look at the sky!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Meow yes i see the sky and can tell that indeed something is going on.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: But aside from that i dont really understand what you said being a cat and all.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; thats fine, you dont have to try too hard</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; all you have to know is its the scratch and im not a hundred purrcent sure what happens next fur you</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Purr purr i still think its nice how you slip cat things in the things you say youre so clever and wonderful nepeta!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; h33h33h33 :DD</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Whats the scratch? :3</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; well you know roses friend john?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Yes of course!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; imagine that he is using this great big circle like a really fun scratching post, and it makes all this light come out that changes everything</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; just after he starts doing that the sky goes funny everywhere and then i cant s33 you anymore</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Yes. :3</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; thats what it is</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: I think i understand that completely!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; im a bit nervous for you, especially since you remind me so much of someone i already lost</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; but maybe youll be ok? i dont know</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Im not worried nepeta so you shouldnt either its not as if i have never died before.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; you are a brave kitty, just like pounce was &lt;33</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Pounce was a cat like me?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; yes! she was amazing, i bet you and she would have gotten along famousely</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Ooh i bet youre right! Purr purr.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Was she nice to sniff?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; yes she smelled really good, and also, she was SUPER beautyifful.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Wow!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; did you ever have someone nice back on earth who you loved?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Rose!!!!! I loved rose. :3</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; h33h33, of course you did. i mean a nice cat who was your matesprit?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: There was a time i remember i was thinking about girl cats a lot for some reason.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: I would saunter around the house making all these big meows and looking out the windows with my nose touching the glass.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: But then roses mom took me to this place where i was scared to be for a while and then when i was at home again i didnt do the meows anymore.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: I guess i didnt think about the girl cats after that which is just as well because none ever came to the windows really not even when i did my biggest meows.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; thats too bad</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; but i bet lots of girl cats would have loved to be with you, if only there had b33n some around to hear your lovely meows :33</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Youre really nice to say so nepeta what about you though?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; me?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Yes. :3</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; well</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; i have never told anybody this not even my moirail</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; heh, actually hes the LAST guy i might tell, he so wouldnt appurrve X33</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; but yes i have liked somebody for quite some time, but alas he doesnt know it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: What dont you tell him?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; hmmmmm</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Maybe you can win his affection by rubbing your cheek against him thats what i would do.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; ohhh no no no, im too shy even for that!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; and he is so adorably grumpy all the time, it probably wouldnt go over well</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; its hard to explain, maybe cats think diffurntly, but trolls tend to be pretty cautious about expressing their f33lings when it comes to the flushed quadrant</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Whats a quadrant?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; it is</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; ummmmmmmm</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; okay it has romantic applications but it is also something more general than that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; a quadrant is</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; how do i say this!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: :3</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; a quadrant is a thing in a group of things that consists of four similar things</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Like paws?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; EXACTLY like paws!!! :DD</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: I see thats really easy to get.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: I think you should tell him that you like him you might not get the chance if you dont.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: For instance i think instead of meowing at windows i should have just scurried out a door before it could close!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Then i might have found a girl cat to sniff oh well. :3</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; i know, but its just not that simple. i could make someone else jealous i think, and what if he doesnt f33l the same way, and, urrgh, its so complickated</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; maybe i just n33d to let go of the silly infatuation</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; i think its never going to happen honestly</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: You shouldnt lose hope!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: I have another story that might give you hope even though it should be noted again that im only a cat.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; oh?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Yes one time i was with rose and i was sitting there dressed up in my suit with her as happy as can be.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: But then she disappeared!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: The whole place disappeared and i was in another place. There was no rose there was someone else.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: I guess i loved her too in time but never as much as rose it just wasnt the same.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: I kept waiting to see rose again but never did and finally i lost hope that i would and then i died.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: But then i became alive again and i got to see her and i was so happy! Purr purr purr purr purr.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Thats my story and thats why i think theres always hope even if you die.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; so, youre saying that maybe i will have to die to get to be with him?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f141ef">JASPERSPRITE: Yes maybe. :3</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; i hope thats not the case!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; but i guess you just have a different way of looking at things</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #416600">AC: :33 &lt; thank you for the advice jaspers!</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: it had a black tie, and no ghost, so i improved it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">GT: actually...</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: and it was clear dave was never gonna do the quest i didnt get the chance to finish</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: not even after you brought the forge</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: the forge?</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: figuring there wasnt much hope in beating him this time either especially being injured and all but what the hell right</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: but then</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: thats when you lit the forge somehow</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: i did?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: but i just feel so scared and helpless</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: sounds like you came back because jade made the decision for you</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: i made the decision to come back myself maybe itd be different if you had the same chance</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: i dont know if i would have if i had the chance</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: but i would like to not feel so useless to everybody</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: i think everyones on top of this</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TG: could you just please turn the thing around and come back</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Why?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm already out here. Might as well go through with it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: we agreed id do it though</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: or at least you pretended to agree</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TG: sports</span>

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's always been pretty sad that I seem to know more about sports than you. Which is really saying something.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: no one likes a basketball hog</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: It's probably just &quot;ball hog.&quot;</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TG: i just think you should know</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: that in the athletic arena of competitive achievement</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TG: and yet</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: such has been whats happened</span>

<span style="color: #b536da">TT: That's not even close to being a thing in football.</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TG: but instead of winning the gold sports prize you just fucking die and nobody cares and it didnt mean anything</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Which prize is that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: the football prize</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TG: its called the bruce bombardi trophy or something</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: yes poser it should be my torso getting pulverized by that avalanche of overpaid beefcakes and you know it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I forget what we were doing exactly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Were we pursuing the hackneyed debate over who has the best claim to self sacrifice,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: Or seeing who can out-dumbass the other with obtuse sports lingo?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: there obviously stopped being a difference between those things the question is offensive</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TG: almost as offensive as you stalling me while you peel out of here in your dumb moon</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: I'm the one stalling?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">TT: The moon is probably just a speck in the sky now due to your strange beefcake harangue.</span>
<br />

<br />

<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: i busted into his palace</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: to finish the quest</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: i was expecting him to be asleep and was gonna figure out some way to wake him up</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: but like last time i saw him</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: he was already awake to greet me</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: but i thought the denizens were supposed to be asleep?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: at least until you do the right things on your quest...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: they are</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: as sprites were programmed to know things like that about the game</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: but i guess not everything</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: it seems like if you try to go fight them too soon</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: you find them awake and theyre like</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: what the fuck are you doing here already</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: which is what happened last time i saw him</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: before i became a sprite</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: and i stupidly tried to fight him which was a bad idea because hes hella strong</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: and the whole time he was raving about shit</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: about a stolen sword and missing forge</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: but i wasnt really listening</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: if i had i might have understood</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: he wasnt actually trying to kill me he was giving me the choice</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: what choice</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: wait i mean <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Choice</span></span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: i always forget i can talk underlined for important shit</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: what did you choose?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: i guess i made an unwitting choice</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: by deciding to flee</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: i figured he was unbeatable so i decided to get the fuck out of there</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: so i snapped a quick captcha to get his huge hammers code and then gtfo</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: what happened when you saw him this time?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: like i said he was awake again</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: but this time i wasnt in any condition to fight</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: so i didnt</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: and thats what i didnt get</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: hes this terrible angry monstrous guy but theres no need to fight him</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: so he looked me up and down all hard</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: saw the broken sword</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: and like before gave me the choice</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: you mean <span style="text-decoration: underline">Choice</span>!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: <span style="text-decoration: underline">hehehe :p</span></span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: oops</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: yeah</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: so it was the same choice?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: no</span><br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: it was different</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: i think it must be always different</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: depending on the circumstances</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: i dont know what the choice is when you face him the way youre supposed to</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: but im showing up as this bleeding bird sprite holding his broken sword</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: so thats pretty odd situation</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: then what did he make you decide?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: he sees i got his sword and its busted and you can tell hes pissed</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: but like before its like restrained anger</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: like hes always about to just fucking flip but still keeps it together</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: so he can tell me</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: he can repair it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: and make the deringer with the forge lit</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: he says he can repair anything</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: but only one thing</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: and i had to choose</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: so i said ok fix the sword</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: as opposed to what?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: meh</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: doesnt matter really</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: i just thought making the sword felt like the right thing</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: oh...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: so i gave him the sword</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: but it still wasnt all that simple</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: he needed lava from the forge to make it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: which means echidna had to be awake</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: our denizens had to have some kind of truce to make it happen</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: see what i mean about it being complicated</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: yeah ._.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: so jade must have done something right</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: to wake her up and get the forge going</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: dont know what she did though</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: probably something amazing</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: she is still working so hard to help everyone</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: i guess i used to be that way...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JADESPRITE: but ive completely forgotten how</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DAVESPRITE: the battlefield will probably be wiped out soon</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i was tricked by a troll into flying up to the last gate, using this rocket pack.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: she said i could take a shortcut and go kill my denizen while he was sleeping.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: it... </span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: did not quite work out that way.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: This sounds like Terezi's handiwork.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i don't know. she didn't tell me her name.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: she was a blind troll. she made me this incredibly shitty map for me to follow!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yep. That's her.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I guess she got 8oth of us then. Un8elieva8le.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: she tricked you too?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Well, not tricked, so much as made a pointless coin flip and sta88ed me in the 8ack.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: wow. that's pretty cold blooded!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Oh, sure. She was easily the most underhanded and villainous mem8er of our group.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: 8ut I did let my guard down. And even when she sta88ed me, I sure didn't think I was going to die.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: why not?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It turns out immortality isn't all it's cracked up to 8e. Let's leave it at that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: hmm...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: so i guess you never got around to giving me immortality like you said? or killing me, for that matter.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: explain what?</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: if i had decided not to take the shortcut, i would have lived. and then you would have talked to me a lot?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Yes, that's right.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I guess I should have learned to give you more credit 8y now.</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: well, i might not have figured that out, if not for...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: some things that just happened.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: I still can't 8elieve I'm meeting a version of you that doesn't remem8er a thing a8out me. None of my gr8 exploits, or any of the ways I helped you. Only that one stupid time I taunted you!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: It's a vaguely frustr8ing feeling.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: sorry... not sure what to tell you!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: So you remem8er literally nothing I told you a8out myself? Not even the, uh........</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Compromising stuff?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: well, you did just show me around your planet. which was really cool!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: ... there's compromising stuff?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">AG: Your species would think so. 8ut I guess it doesn't matter anymore.</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">EB: i found it very deep in the palace dungeon. i was wandering for hours, following a horrible sound through the pipes.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #4b4b4b">fedorafreak: stand by for clarification re: enthusiastic outburst.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4b4b4b">fedorafreak: yes. it is as hoped for beyond hope.</span>

<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: It is a fairy tale about a young sister and brother who were raised by a wicked witch!</span><br><br><br>
 <b> 07/17/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005856">"[o] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: The witch in truth was a world famous baking baroness. Her cruelty made life miserable for the two children, who did not have their father anymore to protect them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: He was the greatest prankster who ever lived, and a true southern gentleman. He was killed by a comet on the day the boy was born, and the wicked baroness raised them alone, with a hand as firm as that which she ran her brutal baking empire.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: The children pledged to each other that one day they would run away together.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: They followed in the footsteps of the dear colonel, in defiance of the old batterwitch. They studied his every jape, and practiced them in secret!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: But as they grew older, their interests drifted apart. The boy developed a passion for adventure and put aside his study of practical jokes. He dreamed of wealth and fame and discovery and swore he would wander the world.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: One day he decided to run away with the loyal dog he inherited from their father. He asked the girl if she would come along, but she was too scared of the retribution that might follow.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: The boy scoffed at the danger, and assured his sister there was nothing to worry about. But he had not seen first hand what the baroness was capable of!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: He told his sister that he believed in her, and that she could handle whatever the witch could throw at her. And with that, he was off, and she would never see him again.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: The baroness would raise her very strictly, mentoring her in the art of baking. The girl took to the lessons with fierce determination. Her only act of defiance left was to one day surpass the baroness in skill, and beat her at her own game. It was all she could do, for the baroness made sure she knew there could be no escape.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: The girl surely missed her brother, and soon enough he achieved fame for his exploits. She followed him in the newspapers, the tales of his remarkable discoveries, inventions, and riches. How she wished she could rejoin him, and be free from toiling for the pastry hag!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: One day, the girl was able to gather enough bravery to mention her brother to the baroness, and her desire to see him again. With contempt, she guaranteed that this could never happen. When the girl asked why, that is when the baroness began to reveal to her more than just her baking secrets.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: She mentioned that like in many fairy tales, there was more to the children's past than they knew. The colonel was not their father, nor was the baroness their mother. They in fact had no father or mother at all, nor were they ever actually born. They had both fallen from the sky! They were not actually brother and sister as they had been told either. Again like in many fairy tales, the truth was that they were always destined to become married one day. They were to have two children, a son and a daughter, and these children were meant to save the world! But the batterwitch was determined to make sure this destiny would never be realized. In her limitless cruelty she would do all in her power to keep them apart for the rest of their lives.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: The girl that day swore she would bring down the baroness and her evil empire. She would use the many secrets she'd learned over the years against her, and began carefully plotting her downfall.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: Years went by. The girl was nearly ready to put her plan into action. But then, just like that, the baroness disappeared. She was never seen or heard from again.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: The girl was finally free, by a strange turn of events. But not without a final jab from the witch. It turned out that in her will she had left the entire company to the boy!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: The boy, now a grown man, was already very wealthy in his own right. He had no particular need for the baking empire, but assumed control nonetheless, and integrated the company into his extensive collection of enterprises.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: The girl, instead of seeing this as more misfortune, took the news as a relief. She'd just as soon have nothing to do with the witch's empire, and far preferred to pursue her original passion for practical japery. Hoo hoo hoo!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: She considered a reunion with her estranged brother, and once destined husband to be. But the days of longing for a future with him seemed to be from another lifetime. The chance had come and gone. She was content to let him live his increasingly elaborate life, while she sought a simpler one.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: Besides, now was not the time to revisit a destiny with an old star-crossed lover. She had recently become betrothed to a fine, upstanding gentleman. Soon, she would start a family. No, not one meant for heroism as foretold, but one that would make her happy nonetheless.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: In following years, she was left to ponder all that might have been.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: What might have been if there had been no baroness to keep the girl and boy apart?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: What might have been if the baroness had not disappeared, and she had the opportunity to use her secrets against her!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: For you see, the girl had uncovered so many dirty secrets about the terrible batterwitch, including the most troubling one of all.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: Of course no one would have believed her, but she knew.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">pipefan413: She knew the baroness was not human! :B</span>

 <b> 08/11/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005952">"[o] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It is a tale to remind her of the sacrifice she must make. One serving to remind all of her people of the sacrifice once made by long forgotten heroes in a discarded reality. It is of this sacrifice the Sufferer died to speak the truth, and it is his tale I will tell you now.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/11/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005953">"[o] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Once, in this very universe, you could say, Alternia was home to a peaceful race. Trollkind had never known the corrupting influence in their evolution which led them to perpetual war and violence. 
<br />

<br />
That is to say, they had never known me.
<br />

<br />
As was true of the bellicose world we know, there came to be twelve heroes on this peaceful planet. These heroes too had twelve ancestors whose fortunes were entwined with theirs. These twenty-four figures of legend were not of this world but sent from the sky, delivered from a reality not yet conceived. 
<br />

<br />
On the eve of their race's extinction, the twelve heroes would begin playing a game. They would make an admirable effort, but they would fail. Their civilization had not prepared them for the rigors of this game, and the ultimate reward would fall shy of their grasp. But their failure was more comprehensive, more systemic, than a result of simple inadequacy so common to young players of this game. Though they could not recognize it for the bad omen it was, this session was not the one in which they had been spawned. Such is the symptom of a subtle glitch affecting certain sessions, an error designed to trigger an unfathomable cascade of misfortune throughout paradox space. This glitch is the calling card of the one I serve. It is the discreet, gentlemanly manner in which he reserves his place in a universe for later visitation.
<br />

<br />
The heroes, understanding their defeat was absolute, sought advice from the mother of all monsters. She offered them a choice. The heroes could either accept their defeat along with the extinction of their race, and put no others at risk. Or, she could show them a path to a second chance, to a reality in which the chosen heroes of their race would be strong enough to succeed with ease, and claim the reward. This reset would come at the cost of wiping the failed heroes from existence. They would live new lives from scratch, playing different roles in the reset reality, with no memory of the game they played or the choice they made.
<br />

<br />
The heroes chose to accept this bargain, and scratched their session. In doing so they jumpstarted the reality in which the twenty-four figures of legend would together be created - and I as well - and then sent back in time to take our places in history. Though I was delivered well before history even began, before the dawning of life on their planet. This time around, I would oversee its development, and thus fulfill the mother's promise of an aggressive, ruthlessly prepared group of heroes. One that would not rest until victory was secured.
<br />

<br />
The young twenty-four would again be scattered in two groups, twelve modern contemporaries, and twelve ancients. But in addition to losing their memories of everything that had happened before the scratch, there was another catch for the failed heroes. In the new reality, they would not serve as the heroes. They would mature to become the ancestors of the twelve they formerly regarded as theirs, and this twelve would be chosen for glory. These children would be the heroes to achieve victory, and have the reward easily within reach.
<br />

<br />
Of course this promise was fulfilled to the letter, as you have seen. The entire bargain was executed without a single hitch, as those authorized by my master always are. There was however one minor anomaly. One of the failed heroes, in his new life as an ancient on this now brutal planet, began to remember. This is his story.
<br />

<br />
This is the story of the Signless.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/12/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005954">"[o] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Few ever knew the Sufferer's given name, presuming quite reasonably he had none, and he came to be called Signless. Unlike his peers distributed elsewhere in history, he was not given a sign at a young age. Alas, there were no signs reserved for one of his mutant blood. His genetic deviation from the social order made him a pariah, forcing him to wander the world alone for many sweeps, concealing the color of his blood to avoid certain execution.
<br />

<br />
But it may also have been due to his mutation that he began to have the visions. Spontaneous, lucid imagery of his world in peace, before its fall. He would never see the complete picture, or fully understand his previous incarnation's role in prompting this fall, or know of my hand in it. But the visions showed him all he needed to see. They held the promise of his people's true potential, beneath the ages of conditioned cruelty. They held the spark of revolution.
<br />

<br />
In time, the visions gave purpose to his travels. He would preach heretical ideas no one else had dared to entertain, let alone risk discussing. He espoused the virtues of forgiveness, compassion, and equality among all bloodlines. He distributed his message intelligently, careful to preach only to those receptive, never attracting unwelcome attention. But his growing movement could go unnoticed by the authorities for only so long.
<br />

<br />
The highbloods were livid over the unprecedented heresy, and soon, a massive sectarian war followed, spreading across the planet and throughout the galaxy. The conflict was lopsided of course, with the Highbloods given full support from the Condesce and her sea dwellers. Inevitably, the Signless would be captured, and when he was, it was not a matter of whether he would be put to the irons, but how hot they would be if he failed to recant.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/12/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005955">"[o] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
During his penance, it was said the Sufferer's compassion for his people underwent a divine transformation, into limitless, burning rage. It burned hotter than the irons shackling him to the imperial flogging jut, and redder than the blood soaking his Righteous Leggings. When he was finally killed, his anger rung through the cosmos with his last breath. This Vast Expletive was his final sermon, and somewhere encoded in its wavelengths was the truth in his teachings, waiting to reveal itself to any who would inherit his burden.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/12/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005956">"[o] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
His teachings would also persist through surviving disciples, but in hushed tones. His following would dwindle to an obscure cult facing persecution for centuries. After his execution, the body was burned leaving only his irons. They cooled in the ash, as if his anger itself was subsiding, and his followers appropriated their shapes in defiance of the Highbloods. The symbols became the sign of the Signless, always shown as colorless as the cold iron, to conceal the stigma of his hue. This was as much a reminder to his followers to remain hidden as it was of the Sufferer's sacrifice, and his rage hidden like heat in the iron, one day to be reignited by another of his bloodline. 
<br />

<br />
The Sufferer preached that after he passed, another Signless would come, heralding the end times for their planet. The Second Signless would continue his work, and lead his people to glory beyond this realm. The followers kept his teachings alive for ages, even as the uproar surrounding the movement subsided. By modern times, the Sufferer's scripture was little more than ancient superstition all but forgotten. Hardly the anathema of old. But the followers had already made their preparations in the shadows, and when the Second Signless finally came he would have a lusus to raise him and a sign to his name.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/13/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005957">"[o] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The Sufferer required a less conventional upbringing to reach maturity. As a young grub, he landed in the brooding caverns where he would be expected to face his trials. But due to his mutation, surely no lusus would select him. No creature sympathetic to his scent had been bred yet. His odds for survival would have been remote, if not for a chance encounter.
<br />

<br />
The Dolorosa belonged to the rare class assigned strictly to serving the mother grub in the caverns, forbidden from visiting the surface. While on an errand, she found the young Sufferer in his crater and immediately recognized the child as special, as well as in great danger. For an adult troll to raise a child was unthinkable, but she saw no other hope for him. The Dolorosa abandoned her duties in the caverns, and fled to the surface to raise him.
<br />

<br />
In time, she would become the first follower of his teachings, and the first of his inner circle. But not his closest.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/13/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005958">"[o] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Surrounding him on his rise to infamy and throughout the rebellion were the most trusted elites among his devoted. The <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/psiwhite.gif" border="0" />iioniic was a mage of unequaled telekinetic ability, who upon hearing the words of the Sufferer was inspired to free himself from the sort of slavery typical of his mentally gifted class. 
<br />

<br />
But his most devoted of all was his Disciple. She listened to every vision he retold, every lesson he preached, and faithfully recorded his scripture. Her ear was open to him always, and in time, his heart opened to her. To spread his message throughout the world they took to the seas in the vessel of legend known as the First Ship. It was said their love went beyond the four quadrants, transcending the grid entirely. Whatever that nonsense actually means.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/13/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005959">"[o] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The Disciple was to be killed along with him. But at the last moment, the E%ecutor inexplicably took pity on her, and allowed her to escape. She absconded with the Leggings, which remained the only physical evidence of his holy suffering. She hid in caves for many sweeps, transcribing all of his scripture from memory on the walls in the blood of slain creatures, and lived the rest of her days in monastic savagery. Her dedication would be critical to the persistence of his message.
<br />

<br />
But the Dolorosa was less fortunate, and was sold into slavery. She spent the rest of her life as property of vicious sea dwellers. As for the <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/psiwhite.gif" border="0" />iioniic, he was enlisted in a far worse, if more prestigious service.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/15/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005960">"[o] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
He was forced to serve as the Helmsman for Her Condescension's imperial battleship. Psychics of his kind were exploited for interstellar travel, and his abilities made her ship the fastest in the fleet by far. She grew so enamored of her Helmsman and his power, she would use her touch to extend his lifespan to match her own.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/15/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005961">"[o] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Together they explored the stars for thousands of years. Due to the speed of her ship, she would personally expand the boundaries of her empire, typically being the first to greet new races before conquering them.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/15/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005962">"[o] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
After making first contact, occasions which she generally kept cordial, she would move on to new territory while a division of her fleet set a course for the unfortunate civilization, and proceeded to tear it apart. It could be any of the lethal brigades under her command to receive the orders, be it the Threshecutioners, Cavalreapers, Laughsassins, or Ruffiannihilators. Each was notoriously cruel in its own way, and each carried out orders with absolute loyalty. Because while the Condesce could extend a single life on her whim, she could just as casually cut short that of millions.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/15/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005963">"[o] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
If angered, she could simply express her grievance through communion with her ancient lusus of the deep, and turn its psychic devastation on her multitudes. The class hierarchy played into her hands politically in this respect. Killing off a haphazard swathe of the population, or an entire class, was suitable as a measure of last resort, but mass extermination does not lend itself well to practical governance. Its looming threat however is quite effective, especially while her empire was partitioned neatly into blood castes. She could use her leverage to delegate oppression to the subjugglators, whose unique abilities and exceptional brutality made them natural enforcers. They too would delegate in their governance, exploiting the pride and loyalty of dangerous bluebloods beneath them, and so on down the hemospectrum, until the enslavement of the common castes was inescapable, in spite of their genetic gifts and strength in numbers. As a self-governing body, the land dwelling portion of her empire was formidable. But her force of sea dwellers was equally formidable, and the two were kept in check not only with the threat of psychic annihilation, but their mutual hatred and distrust. 
<br />

<br />
The only threat to her power was unification through uprising, a possibility made remote once she fully decentralized the race from the homeworld. She scattered all but the children throughout the galaxy after the most recent rebellion led by the Summoner. Upon doing so, she became so comfortable with her grip on power, she risked venturing deeper into space than ever before to grow her empire.
<br />

<br />
But the more space she put between herself and Gl'bgolyb, the more she risked weakening her bond with the monster. The bond she and her successor shared with it exclusively could sway, and become strengthened with the younger. Perhaps she grew complacent with the threat successors posed, after such a long history of killing them with ease. Heiresses upon reaching maturity were expected to challenge the Condesce for the throne. It was not merely expected of them by their people, but demanded by their shared lusus. 
<br />

<br />
I like to think of her as the pet I gave to their race, at the dawning of their species' evolution. Like a sentience-warming gift. Again, it's just the sort of thing a good host does.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/15/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005964">"[o] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
If the lapse in her custodial bond was significant enough, it was not just political power she risked. At such a distance, she sacrificed concentration needed to curb its most dreadful psychic shriek of all, the galaxy-wide extinction event called the Vast Glub. 
<br />

<br />
Of course this eventuality proved a fitting reward for such reckless expansion of her territory. She chose the worst time possible to explore further from the homeworld than she'd ever been. She was scouring the edge of the galaxy for systems to plunder when she received word of her planet's devastation by meteors. The young were being slaughtered. The mother grub was dead. The end times were upon her people. 
<br />

<br />
She ordered all fleets to return to Alternia. But such was her empire's expansion and interplanetary occupation, few could make it in time to provide any meaningful defense. She instructed her Helmsman to pilot the ship faster than he ever had, and he did so through extreme physical duress. He was able to leap across thousands of light years in a matter of hours. The exertion likely would have killed him, if the Glub didn't get to him first. Her touch could extend life, but never restore it, to her lament.
<br />

<br />
In that instant, her empire was gone. Gl'bgolyb's swan song wiped out her entire race, save the Condesce and her lone heiress, leaving the empire nothing more than a galactic necropolis of floating tombs.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/15/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005965">"[o] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
She was forced to continue the journey home on auxiliary power. Her ship now travels near the speed of light, a pale shadow of its former velocity. It would take her another 612 solar sweeps after the Glub to reach her destination.
<br />

<br />
She should arrive any minute now. When she does, she will find nothing but ruins and dust. If she cared to look closer, she would find a city of slain exiles, a man on the moon, and a pair of black lovers locked in a deadly dance. But whether she looks or not, one thing will find her with certainty.
<br />

<br />
A new employment opportunity.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/16/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005966">"[o] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Are you paying attention, protege? This is where your role in the story begins. 
<br />

<br />
Now stop your pouting and listen, unless you want another helping to the backside of my...
<br />

<br />
Oh nuts. I seem to have forgotten my discipline broom.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/16/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005967">"[o] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Anyway, the last of the twelve ancestors arrived a bit late. In fact, she would cross through her portal six centuries after the descendants had come and gone. There weren't many left to look after her, so she ended up in foster care.
<br />

<br />
I remember it like it was yesterday. And for one who has as much time on his hands as I, it essentially was.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/16/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005968">"[o] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
I would raise the girl to be groomed for her calling. My lessons would emphasize obedience, mastery of the clockwork majyyks, and being locked in a room.
<br />

<br />
As you must have gathered by now, my employer will enter this universe quite soon. I will then relinquish my custody to him, and she will serve as his Handmaid for an eternity to be specified. As you must have also gathered, she has already done so. Though her most common of blood should have let her expire in just a dozen or two sweeps, his curse kept her very much alive. 
<br />

<br />
And she did not intend to stay that way.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/16/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005969">"[o] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
His curse is one of conditional mortality, with the desired outcome contingent on her service. When I release her, she will take her place at his side, and travel through time to carry out his orders.
<br />

<br />
While I am his weapon of subtlety and precision, the Handmaid is strictly an apparatus of terror and suffering. We have both paved the road to his arrival, I in my way and she in hers. She would be present during every watershed moment in her civilization's development. Her recurrance in history would earn her the reputation of a demoness, more feared than even her master, a man though dreadful rarely makes himself seen. She stirred up class warfare and intensified bigotry in whatever era she haunted. She made sure the descendents would enter a world which prepared them well for the game, and took measures to see that they would play as they did. 
<br />

<br />
But once they entered and their world was in ashes, her work was nearly complete. Now, six centuries later, she would be given one last order to follow before her curse was lifted. 
<br />

<br />
A simple recruitment job.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/17/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005970">"[o] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The Handmaid will enlist the Condesce, extending the same bargain once offered to her. It will be the sort involving neither negotiation nor possibility of refusal, expressed in terms plainly understood by the psychotic genocidal. The Condesce will serve as her new master's witch, carrying out his work in the places he cannot reach.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/17/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005971">"[o] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The two last trolls alive, blood of rust and royalty, will make each other pay for the crimes against their race. Their payment will be mutually dealt in the currency of punishment and reward at once. The Condesce will be rewarded with the power and immortality her new service entails, and punished by the grueling slavery for which it is synonymous. And you, young lady, are to be punished by death at the hands of your replacement. And so too will this be your reward.<br><br><br>
 <b> 08/17/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=005972">"[o] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

And so, my dear, that is the inspiring tale of your people, and why you should feel rather privileged to be in the position for which I have groomed you meticulously. Are you not grateful? Yes, surely you are, and it warms the soft fluffy material in my chest to know this. What is it? What are you looking at over there?

Ah, of course. The clock. I can see you have a good eye for a fine timepiece. Your exemplary taste is certainly owed to a quality upbringing.

And the Knight of Blood so embraced the Bard of Rage, and in each other's arms they were aquiver. And with righteous pap and blessed shoosh he did quell his brother's fury. For the Knight looked upon his Bard all acting up and completely losing his shit and he did resolve to calmeth his juggalo ass right the fuck down. And so calmed down his juggalo ass was and would continueth to be for all time. And the Knight in totally settling a murderous clown's ludicrous shit down proper said, Let there be Moirallegiance: and it was so. And between moirails would flow bounteous mirth, and they did hug bumpeth plentifully, and honks of reconciliation echoed far and true into the darkness upon the face of the deep.<br><br><br>

All these great designs were by <a href="http://rendigo.tumblr.com/post/60450019230/my-beta-kids-shirts-are-officially-up-for-sale-in" target="_blank">Rennie Kingsley</a>. Alpha kid designs by the same artist will be coming soon too.

<br><br>

There will be so many other cool things hitting WP this fall, I honestly couldn't list them all off the top of my head. Just keep refreshing the site constantly. Even in your sleep. Then you will be ok.
