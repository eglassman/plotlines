<br />
A young lady stands in her bedroom. It just so happens that today, the 11th of November, 2011, is the date scheduled for the launch of a highly exclusive playtesting experience for a much anticipated game. The young lady is expecting to find this game in her mailbox today. She is expecting the game to be enclosed in a pair of envelopes, and printed on these envelopes, she is expecting to find her name!
<br />

<br />
What do you suppose the name on the envelopes will be?<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/11/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006016">"Enter name."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You cannot enter her name!!! It was already engraved in her HONORARY PLACRONYM on her 13th birthday, which was about two and a half years ago, and has been sitting here neatly on the bookshelf ever since. Attempting to engrave it with another name after completing this sacred rite of passage is practically unheard of, and is a gesture nearly as offensive as it would be if you tried to name her something dumb like Barnstench Fartface. Luckily she is not the sort to hold a grudge, and she will let it slide this time. As long as you hurry up and get her big day started!<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/11/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006017">"Examine room."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your name is JANE. As was previously mentioned, you are poised for an ELITE OPPORTUNITY to test the SBURB ALPHA. It is so elite in fact, you are the only of your kind invited to playtest! Though you guess that probably comes with the territory of being the HEIRESS APPARENT TO A BAKED GOODS EMPIRE. You don't suppose it hurts that you are said empire's NUMBER ONE FANGIRL, either! It should come as no surprise that you enjoy BAKING, but you also adore reading DETECTIVE STORIES. You fancy yourself a SKILLED PRANKSTRESS, if by no other measure than lineage. Though at times you feel it's tough to fill those shoes when you are SURROUNDED BY JOKERS. Seriously, the shenanigans perpetrated by your pals make your old school japes feel KIND OF PEDESTRIAN SOMETIMES, but oh well, you love them all anyway. You once dabbled in AMATEUR BOTANY but found it TOO FRUSTRATING, because your VEGETABLES KEPT DISAP-actually you know what, you DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. You love SITUATION COMEDIES, whilst holding particular affection for MUSTACHIOED FUNNYMEN. You know, your FOXWORTHIES, your FUNKES, your SWANSONS, but not necessarily your GALLAGHERS PER SE, because you have to draw the fucking line somewhere. You are also pleased to contemplate FRIGHTENING FAUNA, though saddened by their regrettable FAKENESS ATTRIBUTE.
<br />

<br />
But none of that's on your mind now, because you are PSYCHED about this SPECIAL DATE, 11.11.11, i.e. 2X3PRONG DAY (WHATEVER THAT MEANS), a date exhibiting just the sort of numerical gimmick corporations love to exploit for their big releases, or for launching MAJOR REBRANDING INITIATIVES. In the case of your CHERISHED MULTIGLOBAL EMPIRE, both such events are slated to happen today. You can't wait to see what is in store, and for the mail to come. When it does, you will waste no time in embarking on the game's MAIDEN VOYAGE, and if even a fraction of what you've heard turns out to be true, you are prepared to have the time of your LIFE!!!
<br />

<br />
What will you do?<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/11/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006018">"Jane: Quickly retrieve arms from chest."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Jane is not empowered to rehash this tired running gag because all of a sudden she is too busy being the other guy.
<br />

<br />
We need to figure out what this fella's name is, pronto!<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/11/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006019">"Enter name."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Once again, you make the incalculable blunder of attempting to engrave an already allocated placronym. His name was etched when he turned 13 too, almost 3 years ago. It's been sitting here messily in this UNBELIEVABLY DEADLY PILE OF GUNS ever since. What sort of vulgar, childish moniker were you going to stick this poor bastard with? Barfbreath Turdsmirk? It doesn't even matter. Just tell him what to do!<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/11/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006020">"Examine room."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your name is JAKE. You love movies. ALL MOVIES. You would describe your taste in film as ECLECTIC, but in truth, it isn't much less than TOTALLY INDISCRIMINATE. You bluster frequently of exuberance for FIREARMS and FISTICUFFS and ADVENTURE, though have no human company with which to share these interests. But who needs chums, when you can enjoy a top notch gander of your GALS OF CERULEAN COMPLEXION, HUBBA HUBBA. You're known to be found with your nose in a COMIC BOOK OR TWO, not that it makes you a nerd or anything, like you even CARE about that! Not a gent of your PANACHE AND SWAGGER, qualities which you would BANDY WITH APLOMB on your globe-spanning adventures, HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING. You would love to travel around the world, toppling any SACRED URNS you encountered. You'd be tickled by the opportunity to defile HALLOWED TOMBS everywhere, raiding them of their treasures. And how you'd give your RIGHT LEG for a shot at desecrating THE SHIT out of some real life MYSTIC RUINS for their byzantine wares. Luckily for your limb, there is a dandy set of such ruins nearby, and you desecrate them quite frequently! You are also troubled to contemplate FRIGHTENING FAUNA, and plagued daily by their regrettable REALNESS ATTRIBUTE.
<br />

<br />
What else? You sure like to WRESTLE. Did you mention FISTICUFFS yet? You know, SCRUMS AND WHATNOT. Also, SKULLS. Gosh you love SKULLS. There is a good SKULL at the heart of any mystery, haunting its EVERY PAGE. That is what you always say. Or at least, it is what you always HOPE.
<br />

<br />
What will you do?<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/11/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006021">"Jake: Retrieve arms from floor, post-haste!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make a dutiful motion toward your TRUSTY FIREARMS, doing your part to assail the mushy carcass of a horse that passed away long ago, when suddenly a WILD CHARACTER-SELECT SCREEN APPROACHES!!!!!!!!!!
<br />

<br />
You really feel like you are in the driver's seat now. You can basically take this story LITERALLY ANYWHERE, as long as you don't pick one of those shadowy characters, and as long as the panels are actually finished being drawn. It is like this whole panoramic cornucopia of limitless possibility sprawling before your very eyes.
<br />

<br />
Who do you want to be?<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/11/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006022">"Be Jane."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are suddenly Jane again. What was it you were up to? Oh right, this game. You're excited about that!
<br />

<br />
Earlier this morning you thought you heard the mail truck, even though the mail never comes in the morning. But just to be sure, you rushed downstairs to check, even though due to recent events, you are FORBIDDEN FROM LEAVING THE HOUSE. Alas, it was not there, and you sort of spaced out at the sky with a goofy grin on your face for no great reason, and then you were caught red handed by your guardian. Then you got in trouble.
<br />

<br />
You think you might be grounded now? Whatever, <span style="font-style: italic">DAD!</span><br><br><br>
 <b> 11/12/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006023">"Jane: Examine fetch modus."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It's your RECIPE MODUS, an extremely handy little inventory widget your DAD got for you for your birthday a couple years ago. He can be a real hard-ass sometimes (not really), but he sure knows how to spoil his little girl.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/12/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006024">"Jane: Captchalogue it!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You stick the RECIPE MODUS in your... uh... RECIPE MODUS!
<br />

<br />
You flip the card over and look at the back. The thing about this modus you think is really cool is that instead of showing a completely useless wobbly garbled code on the back, it itemizes the components which could be used to create it! In a completely hypothetical framework, of course.
<br />

<br />
Just another wonderful innovation by your favorite company. It releases many products of an experimental nature, often with applicability to other kinds of technology and products which haven't hit the market yet. Of course, as the heiress, you are privy to all the sweetest gear in advance. Maybe you'll rummage through some of that stuff later.
<br />

<br />
The modus as a captchalogued object has only one simple recipe, involving an ARRAY MODUS (snore!) and a COOK BOOK (yesss!) Other objects have more varied and elaborate recipes though.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/12/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006025">"Jane: Get hat."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You captchalogue your FAVORITE HAT, which is also your ONLY HAT. You spent basically your ENTIRE CHILDHOOD in this hat, pretending to be hard boiled detectives and whatnot. In public, you and your DAD made quite the pair. Everyone could tell by a glance that you were your father's daughter, sired from his loins directly and genetically, through what was undoubtedly a natural process of human procreation involving a man and a woman. People would definitely nod and say, &quot;Yep, that little lady sure did emerge from a womb on account of <span style="font-style: italic">that</span> gentleman's awesome virility.&quot;
<br />

<br />
As you can see, there are loads of ways to cook up a hat like this, involving many stupid combinations of random objects.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/12/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006026">"Jane: Inspect posters."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It's one of your funnymen pinups, a glorious FOXWORTHY. It's one interest that overlaps with your DAD'S. He thinks his corny redneck shtick is just the funniest thing since sliced bread, that was sliced by a hilarious clown with a laugh knife. Honestly, you don't care much for his comedy though. Dealing the low income bucolic classes affectionate sass ad nauseum isn't what you'd call your cup of tea. You just think he's really handsome. Every time he starts rattling off pointers on how to self-diagnose bumpkinhood, you just get lost in that pair of blue twinklers and those soft auburn lipbristles. You were so shy when you got the poster autographed. If only you felt WORTHY of <span style="font-style: italic">that</span> FOX, heh heh.
<br />

<br />
Oh and there's one of your PROBLEM SLEUTH posters. You've got a lot of Problem Sleuth stuff, because you think detective stories are just so swell. This was the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=4&amp;p=001892" target="_blank" class="postlink">last panel</a> in the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=4" target="_blank" class="postlink">first story</a>, which ended a little before your 13th birthday. Since then, the author has been steadily updating PROBLEM SLEUTH 2, which you have been following avidly. You are happy that he stayed in that lane, and stuck with a time-tested formula. If he went in a different direction, you probably would have found it really disappointing.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/12/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006027">"Jane: Check out other posters."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Another Sleuth poster of course, with two of your favorite dames ever. 
<br />

<br />
The TOBIAS and the MANHATTAN were gifts for your 14th birthday, sent to you by your good buddy Jake. Just a couple of PERIWINKLE HEARTHROBS unquestionably sent in playful retaliation for the ribbing you've given him over the years for his inexplicable infatuation with his phthalo femmes. So he made a couple of coy recommendations for objects of your attraction, and you have hung his COBALT BEEFCAKES here since. He was pretty spot on with the blue Funke, to be honest, since that's like the best show ever. Mr. Cross can blue himself <span style="font-style: italic">any time</span>, as far as you are concerned. But the Manhattan... not so much. Comics aren't really your thing. But you hung it up anyway because that's the sort of thing you do in a mildly escalating feud of passive-aggressive one-upsmanship. You <span style="font-style: italic">own</span> it. But you felt kind of weird about having his BLUE MUTANT PENIS dangle over your head while you sleep, so you covered it up with something even more obscene, some sort of revolting TROLL HOWIE MANDEL, also gifted to you by Jake. Good lord does that kid have some spotty tastes. 
<br />

<br />
There is also your magnificent SWANSON. Ron Swanson is the PERFECT MAN. You have tried to order all of the bacon and eggs in a restaurant on several occasions. But your dad never lets the order go beyond the joke level. What a fuddyduddy.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/12/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006028">"Jane: Take spoon."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You tuck your trusty JUNIOR BATTERMASTER'S BOWLBUSTER STIRRING SOLUTION 50000 into your strife deck, allocated with the ever martially-pragmatic SPOONKIND. You wouldn't have it any other way!
<br />

<br />
You love your fancy spoon. It has several million recipes stored in it, and walks you through each step with a soothing female robot voice, just like in science fiction. Some urban legends say that the device also broadcasts subliminal messages distributing OMINOUS CROCKERCORP PROPAGANDA, but you don't put any stock in that sort of baloney for a second.
<br />

<br />
There is one switch on it that doesn't seem to do anything. Maybe yours is defective? Still, it's perfectly serviceable, and has assisted you in whipping many a cake into delicious submission.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/12/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006029">"Jane: Examine bunnies."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
These customized bunnies were gifts to you on your 13th birthday, from two of your friends. Both were heirlooms passed down to them, and they decided to coordinate gift ideas and send you dressed up versions of their beloved childhood toys. You like to think he was shooting for a detective bunny with the one on the left, but you know realistically it was probably an Indiana Jones bunny more in line with his interests than yours, especially since it came with a little whip you have since misplaced. The bunny used to belong to his GRANDMA. The other one used to belong to your friend's MOM, and she dressed it as a wizard, which was also unapologetically more representative of her interests than yours. That's ok though, you loved the gesture anyway, and you and she are totally BFFSIES 4EVERZ, her words. And you agree with them! 
<br />

<br />
You did get one more bunny from your other pal. He had to make it himself from scratch, since for some ridiculous reason he didn't happen to have a ratty old bunny heirloom lying around. His gift was... somewhat less innocuous. You have no idea where it is though. Probably just as well.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/13/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006030">"Jane: Look out window."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You've been fidgeting around your room all day, making little observations about your various belongings, checking the clock. When will the dang mail get here?? You take another peek out the window, just in case.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/13/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006031">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It's still not there. But there is your dad. What is he up to?<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/13/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006032">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
He just captchalogued the CAR. Oh, that's right. He was going to wash it today. He's probably taking it into the back yard next to the garden hose. He keeps a very busy fatherly itinerary. So many dad things to do, every single day.
<br />

<br />
If the mail arrives soon, this would be a great opportunity to sneak out and get it! Fingers crossed.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/13/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006033">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Looks like somebody is bothering you. He better make it quick! You've got a window to stay glued to.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/13/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006034">"Jane: Go to computer."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You know you really should switch to PESTERCHUM. It's what your friends use, and it's a lot better than BETTYBOTHER, if you're being honest with yourself. BB is just so spammy and annoying with all of the popups everywhere.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/13/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006035">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Ugh, look at this dreadful clutter. You have got to switch. But then, brand loyalty is a powerful thing.
<br />

<br />
Looks like Jake is messaging you.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/13/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006036">"Jane: Answer Jake."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: So if I have this straight, the big thing hogging up your plate today is not this marvelous new game which I have invited you to play with me, but finishing a robotic rabbit to give to my dead poppop?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hey! I have believed in you too.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I don't know what to make of it. Whether it was a vision of the future, or somewhere that exists now, or if it was just a really lucid dream due to excitement.</span>

 <b> 11/14/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006038">"Jane: Wait a minute."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 11/14/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006039">"Jane: Look around."</a></b><br><br>

Yep. This one changed too. Crockercorp is nothing if not thorough with its branding tactics. You <span style="font-style: italic">guess</span> it's pretty cool? It's just a fork instead of a spoon. Not the most awe inspiring logo you've ever seen, but who are you to judge? Aside from the future owner of the company.

Nope, still nothing. You surely would have heard the truck pull up. You guess the empire wasn't able to coordinate the mail with its rebranding.

<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: That is reassuring!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: have yoU corresponded with yoUr first designated co-player yet?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: No, I haven't seen her online yet today.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I'm really hoping Lalonde won't flake out on me this time. Have you heard from her?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: not the today that is local to yoU.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: thoUgh i do have a wee bit more troUble monitoring her than the rest of yoU. cUrioUs dark patches in transmission, hUmph.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: still, i woUldn't fret over it. she is as good a chUm as any yoU have and shoUld come throUgh Ultimately, even if things seem dire.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: If you say so.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I wanted to tell you, I had an amazing dream last night!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: blimey! :U</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I believe it may have been of the sort you described. A dream of awakening, presuming I haven't just flatout lost my marbles.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: indeed, im sUre it was. i knew yoU woUld wake Up soon!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: might yoU describe what yoU saw?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I was in a bright gold city. Above was a brilliant blue sky, but the horizon was dark as night.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Was this the place you told me about? What was it called...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Ah, shucks, does this count as a &quot;causal spoiler?&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: not at all! that is a simple detail aboUt the realm yoU are aboUt to explore, withoUt directly involving yoUr fUtUre decisions of conseqUence.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: the place yoU visited was called prospit. it is where i have woken Up every time i have gone to sleep for most of my life.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I didn't see you there. At least, I don't think I did!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: no, yoU woUldnt have.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: my prospit is an alternate version from yoUrs, in a completely different session qUite far afield of yoUr reality.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: if we are ever to meet in person, it is Unlikely to be while playing oUr respective games!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Ok then.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I mentioned this briefly to Jake, and he didn't have much to say before we parted ways.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I will gather that if this is all true, then it means Jake had not awoken yet?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i think this is for yoU to determine in time. what is yoUr hUnch?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I don't know.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But there was one thing about the dream that was very troubling.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I'm becoming nervous to consider what it might mean.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: Understandable. bUt it will be important to practice patience today.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yoU have a long road ahead of yoU, and many qUestions will be answered in time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt we can talk it over later. now, we both have games to prepare for!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i know yoU coUld never fUlly appreciate what this actUally meant, bUt i took mUch care to sync Up these conversations with yoU on the same day that i begin playing as well.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: that way, we can joUrney throUgh oUr sessions together and compare notes! :u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hrm. I'm still not sure I appreciate what that means, but I appreciate that a nice gesture has been made if you say so!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I guess I should just start believing all of this now, huh? Rather than learning it to be true later and feeling the fool for all my curmudgeonly skepticism?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: ~_u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: For starters, I guess I could drop my reservations about your story?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: will yoU :U!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I can write off much to tomfoolery as I'm no stranger to a good prank myself. But quite honestly you seem too kind for this charade. Not the type I'd expect to trot out such persistent falsehoods beyond their humorous welcome.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: So what do I know! Consarn it, maybe you are an alien girl from Uranus, and together we are about to play a game which determines the fate of existence. Sign me up!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: oh, hee hee! bUt i never claimed to be from that planet, which is only in the far reaches of yoUr solar system.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: in fact i am from mUch farther away. a different Universe altogether.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt if yoU trUly mean it, thank yoU for believing me!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: now, jane my lovely, let Us prepare for this adventUre.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: remember what i said aboUt the need for patience.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: patience with yoUr friends. </span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: patience for yoUr growth as a hero of life.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and patience for the coming of the other foUr of legend.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: a hero of breath and of light and of time and of space!</span>

<span style="color: #929292">UU: and if yoU still find yoUrself in doUbt</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: jUst check the inscription on that big old book downstairs.</span>

 <b> 11/15/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006045">"Jane: Ok, back to the chest."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You return to your BAKING CHEST which you use mainly for storing QUALITY PRANKING APPARATUS and a few other odds and ends.
<br />

<br />
Oh hello, poppop. His friendly face is there to greet you every time you open your chest. You would have loved to meet him. Unfortunately his life was cut short at the tender age of 86 in a tragic accident, coincidentally on the same day you were born, or so your dad tells you. Poppop Crocker was a LEGENDARY COMEDIAN, following in the footsteps of his grandfather who of course was the greatest southern pranking legend of all time. One day, you hope to follow in poppop's too. 
<br />

<br />
But then, if the whoppers you have been told recently have any truth to them, maybe you will get to meet him after all? It seems too good to be true. The only relationship you have ever had with him are through video footage of his VAUDEVILLIAN ANTICS on stage. Or through his role as Judge Johnny Stone on one of your favorite old sitcoms, NIGHT COURT.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/15/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006046">"Jane: Rummage around."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Just your basics when it comes to pranking. A few CLEVER DISGUISES. A NAME BRAND DUNCE CAP. A SLIGHTLY ABRIDGED EDITION OF SASSACRE'S TEXT, updated for the modern prankster and scrubbed of a few of the more egregious julep-fueled racial slurs, several other stray books, your company's prototypical model for the GRISTWIDGET 12000, and of course your super-handy UNREAL HEIRESS THOUGHTWAVE TIARATOP for the young gogetting junior battermaster on the go.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/15/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006047">"Jane: Dump chest."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Might as well get all this crap out of here and take it with you. You never know when you might need it.
<br />

<br />
You shut the chest and... oh, hello Harry Anderson. Always a pleasure to see you there.
<br />

<br />
He is also one of your idols, and as it happens, has a bit of a history with your poppop. They were rivals on the vaudeville comedy and magic act circuit. Eventually the less competent Anderson was shamed out of the industry and went on to greener pastures in the PRIVATE DICKING BIZ. He became one of the hardest boiled detectives on the mean streets of the Big Easy, and later made a fortune off his memoirs (ghost written by Mike Caveney).<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/15/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006048">"Jane: Captchalogue all."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your sylladex is so great. You shudder to remember some of the old shitty fetch modi you used to struggle with when you were younger, still learning the captchaloguing ropes. Fibonacci heap??? Lol at the f'ing noob.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/15/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006049">"Jane: Inspect books."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You have a COOKBOOK, which of course was made obsolete by your computerized talking bowlbuster. You wouldn't dare part with it though. Too many wonderful memories.
<br />

<br />
There's Anderson's aforementioned book, WISE GUY. His (Caveney's) stories are gripping! In a way.
<br />

<br />
And then there's a customized copy of PONY PALS, a gift to you on your 14th birthday from the slippery Mr. Strider. Each page contains lovingly hand-written commentary on the deeds of this intrepid young horse.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/16/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006050">"Jane: Check out gristwidget."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This thing's a piece of junk! It just wastes your boondollars and destroys your cool gear to produce these stupid things that look like Gushers! But unlike Gushers which serve many practical purposes like inducing vomiting and simulating the experience of eating plump insects, these things are totally useless!<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/16/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006051">"Jane: Insert hat card."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Ok, you'll try it out with one of your less prized possessions just to prove how dumb it is. You never liked this hat much. It makes you look like a gnome and basically isn't funny at all.
<br />

<br />
You pop the card in. The GRISTWIDGET indicates it will cost 10 BOONDOLLARS to convert this object into grist. That's not too bad, you guess. It's not like the currency has much value anyway. It was introduced as a sort of BCCORP FUNBUX, to be used by youngsters specifically on qualifying merch online and stuff. Brilliant business strategy, really. As heiress to the empire, you are naturally endowed with millions, which you have a reputation for being very generous with. You have been considering using your wealth to set up a scholarship fund to allow underprivileged kids to go to booncollege.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/16/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006052">"Jane: Activate."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
See??? Utterly pointless. You hope Crockercorp was going somewhere with this technology, cause if not, this product is first in line for getting the axe when you're in charge.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/16/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006053">"Jane: Wear tiaratop."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You put on your highly fashionable UNREAL HEIRESS THOUGHTWAVE TIARATOP and flip it on. It immediately hums to life as its blazing fast processes mingle with your thoughts. It is the most efficient computing technology in the world by far, as long as you don't wear it for too long. But aside from a few migraines, you can't possibly imagine any <span style="color: white">OBEY</span> drawbacks that <span style="color: white">CEASE REPRODUCTION</span> could come with <span style="color: white">SUBMIT</span> merging <span style="color: white">CONSUME</span> your thoughts with <span style="color: white">EMBRACE YOUR CULLING</span> experimental technology <span style="color: white">CONFORM TO SOCIAL ORDER</span> from an <span style="color: white">STAY ASLEEP</span> extremely powerful <span style="color: white">DIE</span> corporation, wait what?<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/16/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006054">"Jane: Continue vigilant window gazing."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Still no sign of the mail. Might as well keep the tiaratop on while you look, even if it means suffering through all these bullshit popup ads. That way you can keep an eye out for Lalonde while you're at it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/16/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006055">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Speak of the devilfucking dickens.<br><br><br>

 <b> 11/17/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006058">"Jane: Prepare to retrieve mail."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You scamper over to the door, but pause a second to think. Is your dad still washing the car? Hopefully he's still preoccupied so you can sneak out.
<br />

<br />
But it doesn't hurt to be prepared for an encounter. Luckily, that is exactly what you are.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/17/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006059">"Jane: Don clever disguise."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Why, is that his loving daughter, or could it be none other than INSPECTOR JACQUES CLOUSEAU??? Mr. Clouseau, what are you doing in this household? Can I bake you a cake? Please make yourself comfortable while I go about my business not being suspicious.
<br />

<br />
But wait, perhaps that is not so much the distinguished Inspector Clouseau as it is...<br><br><br>

<br />
THE WORLD RENOWNED INVESTIGATOR HERCULE POIROT, BECAUSE THE LITTLE CURLY MUSTACHE IS A LOT CUTER.
<br />

<br />
The great Poirot, in THIS house?? Such an honor. I will set the kettle to boil straightaway. Who would have guessed this home would be so heavily trafficked by famous French detectives at this time of day? Oh my, the good Poirot appears to be clucking little pleasantries in his adorable French accent through the high pitched voice of an enthusiastic teen girl. I SURELY don't have the heart to ground this upstanding, dapper gentleman, no matter HOW many dastardly attempts are made on her life.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/17/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006061">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Yeah, this is a really shitty disguise.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/17/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006062">"Jane: Exit."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make a cautious motion toward a beckoning EXIT KNOB, when suddenly THE SAME WILD CHARACTER-SELECT SCREEN REAPPROACHES NONTHREATENINGLY!
<br />

<br />
You note that you still cannot pick one of the shadowy characters. But maybe you haven't been the other guy yet? That means it's time to click him.
<br />

<br />
Or maybe you already have been him, in which case you are done with this thing. The narrative really has no way of knowing. Your ass remains firmly planted in the driver's seat, as always.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/17/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006063">"Be Jake."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And just like that, back to Jake. What was it you were up to? Oh right, you were going to pick these dang guns up off the floor when you were interrupted by some fleeting imperceptible thought. You kind of space out sometimes.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/18/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006064">"Jake: About those arms."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Right. You pick up your TWIN M9 BERETTAS, weapons of choice in an absurd arsenal inherited from an eccentric old woman.
<br />

<br />
Guns are so cool. Your GRANDMA was rad.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/18/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006065">"Jake: Examine holster belt."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It's your authentic TOMB RAIDER SEXY THIGHSTRAP DOUBLE HOLSTER, complete with cool skullbuckle and everything. You like to think you pull it off about as well as Croft herself.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/18/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006066">"Jake: Wear it."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You like to think that, but in truth you look ridiculous. You think you probably need shorter shorts to make it work? Probably skin tight shorts too. As it is, the cuffs of your baggy shorts get kind of bunched up underneath the thighstraps, which is uncomfortable and makes you look like a tool.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/18/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006067">"Jake: Ok, forget it."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Better off just keeping it in your strife deck.
<br />

<br />
You can draw the guns faster from there anyway.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/18/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006068">"Jake: Examine bed."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You think your bed is some sort of electronic gadget. You're pretty sure those bedpost globes are supposed to glow like light bulbs under certain circumstances. But you've never been able to figure out what purpose it serves. Just more mysterious junk inherited from your eclectic GRANDMA.
<br />

<br />
She also gave you these bedsheets when you were very young, which you adore, but only for sentimental reasons. You aren't too keen on monsters.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/18/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006069">"Jake: Examine posters."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Which posters? Your whole room is nothing but posters. Sometimes you find it hard to focus on any one of them. You just relax your eyes and get lost in all the incredible heroes and adventures which exploded from the silver screen and into your bedroom as well as your heart.
<br />

<br />
Movies are so great. You have never seen a movie you didn't like, you are pretty sure. People give you a hard time for that though. Gosh you love movies. Almost as much as you love skulls. And movies that have skulls in them? Oh my god.
<br />

<br />
So wonderful.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/18/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006070">"Jake: Scope out those blue chicks."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This is your collection of beauties. But you don't call them that to anyone but yourself in private, because somehow even you are aware of how dorky that sounds. 
<br />

<br />
You are oft-times the recipient of a good ribbing from Jane on account of your peculiar fascination with blue movie ladies. You don't have to justify yourself to her though. What is even her deal? Any fella would be off his ROCKER not to fawn over all these BODACIOUS BLUE KNOCKOUTS. You want to make out with all of them.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/18/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006071">"Jake: Make out with all of them."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Dear, sweet Neytiri from James Cameron's Avatar. 
<br />

<br />
Oh, if only you were the one who could have overcome his paralysis on an alien adventure planet to become her boyfriend, instead of that other guy. Then she could have shown you how to be bold and courageous, and stand up to fight for your people, and maybe later, engage in a bizarre extraterrestrial reproductive process involving ponytails, and a magical tree you guess?
<br />

<br />
You'll show that curmudgeonly Strider who's just a gigantic shitty space furry. You will show him what marvelous creatures they are. You'll show him what a daring dream it is, to combine the finest qualities of humanity with...
<br />

<br />
But seriously, you have got to stop kissing this stupid poster.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/19/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006072">"Jake: Stop kissing stupid poster."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Yes, that was a waste of time. Definitely. It's definitely not something you spend much time doing whenever you are alone, which is always.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, here are some other great movies. Weekend at Bernies? Classic. You really think John would like this movie, if the things you have heard about him are true. Guys in cahoots make the silly corpse of Bernie Lomax do zany puppet antics so their schemes can succeed, guffaws aplenty, as you have tried to tell Jade before practically verbatim. She doesn't much care for great movies like that, but that's alright. You love her anyway and you think she's a blast. She says you sound just like John when you say stuff like that though, and that the two of you would get along famously. You can't wait to meet him.
<br />

<br />
Also there are some Cage flicks there. But who doesn't love a good Cage flick? Nobody is who. Dang, you would kill to get your hands on some authentic Cage movie memorabilia. But that'll probably have to remain a crazy dream.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/19/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006073">"Jake: Examine package."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Speaking of John, this is his birthday present. It is the project that has been taking up all your time lately. And today is the deadline to finish it! You have to send it to Jade so that she has time to ship it to him across the Pacific ocean. The TRANSMATERIALIZER you have been using to ship it back and forth is wired to sync up your flow of time with hers, so it's not like you can just take forever with it, and send to the exact time she needs it - you've thought of that! And considering this bunny is PROBABLY going back to the early 20th century, when she and John were around your age, you figure the mail was extra slow back then, so there is not a moment to spare. Whew, time stuff is pretty complicated! But you are FAIRLY sure you've got this figured out.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/19/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006074">"Jake: Examine bunny."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Sure is gonna be a sweet gift. Reminds you a lot of the old ratty bunny you inherited from your GRANDMA, who of course is exactly who you are collaborating with to make this thing. Time loops make you feel a bit fuzzy in the head, but you've always suspected it could very well be the same bunny. At some point in the early 20th century, Jade gave this robo-rabbit to John, and then later it must have been wound up back with Jade... somehow? Then she... uh... removed all the robot parts, hung on to it until she was an old woman, and gave it to you? You guess crazier things have happened. Like the way this whole project started in the first place. Jade tells you this little rabbit here, or Terry Kiser as you like to call him, will save John's life! He will be sitting there on some sort of chess board battlefield, in yellow pajamas, reading a letter, when POW! Kiser to the rescue. So you are taking this responsibility very seriously. You have been for years already.
<br />

<br />
In fact, this project gave you a neat idea for what to do for Jane's 13th birthday a couple years ago. You and your other pals all coordinated gifts, each sending a customized rabbit. Lalonde happened to have another bunny heirloom like yours, and Strider... well, Strider was resourceful as usual. If John enjoys his gift anywhere near as much as Jane did, then it will be time well spent.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/19/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006075">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
There's just one problem! Mr. Kiser here cannot be completed and tested today without a source of power! You will need a little chunk of URANIUM to power the robot, and you are fresh out of the stuff. You have been plundering all of your devices for uranium to refuel the TRANSMATERIALIZER, which requires huge amounts of power any time it sendificates or appearifies the package from the past. Seems to you like excessive energy consumption for just a simple time machine, but what do you know? Unless it's doing something besides shipping it across time. You couldn't imagine what, though.
<br />

<br />
You really should have remembered to ask Jade for some uranium in your last letter to her. Now you're in a fix. You even yanked the uranium out of your COOKALIZER and REFRIGERATOR. You haven't had a decent meal in weeks! Just a lot of canned food from the ruins.
<br />

<br />
This project has been difficult enough as it is without additional bumps in the road like this. You aren't really the best guy at building machines. Jade has been a big help, but she says she couldn't do this alone. As much as it troubles your pride to admit, this project wouldn't be possible without help from your other two technologically savvy friends. And you are slowly coming to the regrettable conclusion that you will not be able to solve this uranium dilemma without asking for Strider's assistance. He's your best bro and all, but the dude never makes anything easy.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/19/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006076">"Jake: Take bunny."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You stash Terry in your PUZZLE MODUS. It's quite a handy modus, allowing you to captchalogue objects of any size, as long as you can fit them all in a finite space by maneuvering the cards around like a big game of Tetris. You like it because it keeps you sharp for solving any puzzles you might find when you go out raiding hallowed tombs, which is never.
<br />

<br />
The bunny fits in ok, but it's a tight squeeze!<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/19/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006077">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The space in your inventory is mainly hogged up by one incredibly huge thing. You guess you should get rid of it. But you can't shake the feeling you might need it someday, and you don't want to risk ditching it and be caught with your pants down later.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/20/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006078">"Jake: Examine comics."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
On your worktable there are a few comic books starring your favorite heroine of all, SPIDER-GIRL. You don't know what it is, but there's something about a girl who has spidery powers and a sassy attitude that is just so cool to you. It's just another quirky fact about you that definitely doesn't have any greater significance, and never will.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/20/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006079">"Jake: Take comics."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Horsefeathers.
<br />

<br />
Forcing the comics into your puzzle sylladex knocked out a bunch of other crap. You have seriously got to reorganize this thing. What were you even thinking captchaloguing all those bullets one at a time, anyway?<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/20/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006080">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Well, as long as one of your preposterously numerous computers has spilled out of your sylladex, you might as well stop procrastinating and contact Strider to... hang on.
<br />

<br />
Maybe later.<br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: That is what im doing right? Giving it to my grandma when she was a kid growing up on the same island i did?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: that is somewhat close to the trUth, and i can see how yoU woUld draw that conclUsion.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: perhaps a draft of the cascading seqUence from which yoUr reality has arisen will pUt yoUr mind at ease.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: imagine two Universes, A and B.</span>

<br />
If you're going to message your good bro, you might as well use a more comfortable computing device. You always found the HUSKTOP to be a little clunky. Way too hands-on.
<br />

<br />
Here are just a few at your disposal. Your grandma always was an advocate of thorough preparedness. She would strongly advise staying not only armed to the teeth, but well equipped in the computational department. You've been taught you should really carry no less than 5 computers on you at all times, like a sensible person.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/20/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006083">"Jake: Don computers."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You put on a few of your more ostentatious devices. Luckily (or unfortunately) you grew up alone, so there was never anyone around to point out how ridiculous you look.
<br />

<br />
These were also inherited from your grandma. In addition to being quite the globe trotting adventuress, she was rather enterprising as well. Her company made many products like this, to compete with the corporation owned by the cruel baroness who raised her. Sadly, BCCorp eventually crushed her company and forced her into exile. You have always hoped that when Jane takes over that foul conglomerate, she will right all of its unspeakable wrongs. You know she will! You believe in her, after all.<br><br><br>

<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I should preface this request with an overture of appreciation.</span>

<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I hope this shit isnt coming across as platitudinous. I really mean it!</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Take it easy, bromide.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Just about the only way I could salvage endearment from this perilous slope of horseshit would be to discover, really fucking soon mind you, it was a preamble to some floundering invitation for me to rush to your vicinity as nakedly as possible.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But since we've already shot that wad's eventuality on so many dry runs of flustered ambivalence that were as hilarious as they were one sided,</span>

<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You know. I've offered to construct the rabbit for you many times before. I would craft a much deadlier model.</span>

<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh i know you would its just...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Damn it man ive told you this is just something i have to do myself.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But it's my responsibility as your friend to offer one last time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Just as it's my responsibility not to just fork over a bunch of uranium just because you ask me in a moment of weakness.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Nope. Not buying it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I know that every ounce of your premium behind can be accounted for in that rabbit, and there's no goddamned denying it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And you know perfectly well where some more uranium can be located.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It seems that you consider me to be, no less than one hundred percent of the time, an obstinate stick in the mud.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I unironically respect your position on this matter. Hey, let's continue to exchange ideas.</span>

He's just so infuriating sometimes! Or at least his responder is. Ok, the real Strider is too.
<br />

<br />
There's barely any difference between them anyway. The responder just uses a few more generic response templates. And even those you suspect the AI is savvy enough to use on purpose for the sake of irony, or to get a rise out of you or whatever. That silicon bastard knows damn well what it's doing.
<br />

<br />
You shed this ridiculous outfit because you look like an idiot. It's time to get serious here. No more fooling around. You need a more dignified looking computer. A thinking man's computer.<br><br><br>

Hmm, no sign of Lalonde online. No surprise there. You wonder if Jane knows where your bro's at? You should try to cool your jets before talking to her.

You are curious about Jane's dream. Sounds like it almost certainly has to do with your imminent adventure. You'll have to remember to get the scoop on that a little later. For now, you have other worries that need your focus.

You have to go downstairs to check something out. You are pretty sure you know what you're going to find though.

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What does the guy have to do, Jake?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You want to wrestle. He's fucking game. Just a man, a machine, a secluded tropical island. Sounds like you died and went to fucking heaven, if you ask me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Seriously, what does this simple, loyal brobot have to do to prove his worth to you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What does he have to do to make you at ease with the alkaline sting of his gentle robogrope? I really want to know.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Maybe he should just rip his heart out of his chest and pound it into green gravel there in the jungle with his hella strong robot arm.</span>
<br />

Ok if he wants happy hunting you will GIVE him happy hunting. HAPPILY.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/22/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006094">"Jake: Exit."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You make a careful motion with a tentative shoe toward the EGRESS CASE, when suddenly THAT DARNED WILD CHARACTER-SELECT SCREEN ACCOSTS YOU BENIGNLY WITHOUT NOTICE!!!
<br />

<br />
You still can't pick a shadowy guy. But maybe you haven't been the other girl yet? Better click her.
<br />

<br />
But if you've been her already, there's really no point to this thing anymore. Time to move on.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/22/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006095">"Ok, I'm done here. Moving on."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are suddenly Jane again. Or, you suddenly keep being Jane. Who can say for sure???
<br />

<br />
Hopefully your dad is still out back washing the car. Ideally this is one of his legendary infinite car washes. What can you say? Dad fancies his automotive ablutions.
<br />

<br />
While he is preoccupied, you should be able to sneak downstairs and grab the mail undetected. The perfect crime? You bet.
<br />

<br />
You slip the HALLWAY CERA a furtive wink for good luck.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/22/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006096">"Jane: Examine portrait."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Just one of your dad's bland HALLWAY DOUCHEBAGS. Another example of his cornball dad tastes, which make you roll your eyes and shrug. Still, it's preferable to how it used to be. 
<br />

<br />
Years ago he would work really hard to mimic your interests throughout the household. Gaudy paintings of sitcom legends covering the walls, hideous detective figurines littered everywhere. You think it's better that he embrace his own interests rather than try to pander to yours. It felt a bit forced, and your early teen years were filled with daily rounds of familial STRIFE. Not so much anymore. Now whenever there is a father-daughter disagreement, you settle things in an adult fashion by being honest about your feelings and talking it through, and also by sneaking around the house in silly disguises.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/22/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006097">"Jane: Take a peek into living room."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
There's a familiar face. A friendly face. Old poppop Crocker, smiling from beyond. Your dad sure misses him. He doesn't like to talk about the day he died. Some incident involving a tall bookshelf, a ladder, and a mysterious young woman in a suspicious looking hat. You have often fantasized about putting on your dirty old fedora and your Frenchest looking mustache to go tracking down this felonious broad and bring her to justice. But your dad always says best to let sleeping dogs lie.
<br />

<br />
There's some other plucky looking tool there next to him. Dunno who that guy is.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/23/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006098">"Jane: Proceed downstairs."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Another hard boiled Anderson. Even though your dad isn't overbearing with all the detective nonsense anymore, he decided to leave this one here for old time's sake. It brings back memories of his very short-lived stint as a private eye. It turns out the police aren't as grateful as you'd think when ordinary citizens go around roughing up a lot of crooks.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/23/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006099">"Jane: Go to front door."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You were afraid this might be the case. Your dad has blocked the front door with the REFRIGERATOR. Looks like he's taking the grounding seriously this time.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/23/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006100">"Jane: Check window."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
He padlocked the windows too. You'd bet boonbucks to donuts the back door is blocked too, probably with the safe from the study or something. The man means business this time.
<br />

<br />
You aren't about to go smashing glass and making a ruckus though. You'll need a solution involving more stealth. You guess you have a plan in mind as a last resort, but you'd rather it not come to that.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/23/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006101">"Jane: Consult with poppop."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You figure a little wisdom from your elder couldn't hurt.
<br />

<br />
It practically went without saying your dad keeps poppop stuffed and mounted in front of the fireplace, as is the family tradition. Poppop grew up with his legendary humorist grandfather stuffed in front of the fireplace, and so did his grandfather. This was stipulated firmly in the will, at the end of a long list of joke stipulations. (Dad knew this was a real stipulation though.)<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/23/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006102">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You always did find it a little macabre though, trying to watch tv and eat dinner on the couch with a dead old man standing about five feet away. You'd honestly prefer he not be kept here in the living room. Sometimes you tell dad you really want poppop in the attic. He says the mere fact you call it that tells him you're not ready.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/23/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006103">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
What's that, poppop? It seems he's concerned that you may not be properly equipped. 
<br />

<br />
You prove to him that you indeed had no intention of leaving the house without your trusty joke book.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/23/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006104">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">YES, I am going out with this book! No, I will not go get an unabridged copy! No, I will not take yours! I can hardly even lift it! Oh, that is so preposterous. Do you even hear what you're saying? I will be fine! This is a perfectly funny book and it contains many incredibly funny jokes! Oh, will you just stop it. I am going now. Good day!!!
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">&gt;:B!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</span></span><br><br><br>
 <b> 11/23/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006105">"Jane: On second thought, take his book."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You just remembered something your alien friend said about the big old book downstairs, and trusting words written by your own hand. What the heck did she mean by that?
<br />

<br />
Uh, whoops. Sorry, poppop.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/23/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006106">"Jane: Retrieve arm."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Better pick that up. You'll try to repair it later before dad sees it and blows a gasket.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/24/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006107">"Jane: Read inscription again."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Is your friend suggesting that you were the one who wrote this inscription? You find that idea a bit hard to swallow. Still, your friends are always babbling about time travel...
<br />

<br />
You always thought this <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002659" target="_blank" class="postlink">inscription</a> was written to your poppop by his nanna, who was your great great grandmother, founder of the corporation you'll inherit in a few years. The message has always been a fascinating mystery to you, and probably was to him as well. From the way it's written, it seems it was intended for him to receive after her death. She talks about a journey he is supposedly meant to go on. You wonder if that adventure ever took place, or if the note was just one last jape by an old woman from a proud family of pranksters? She goes on about many fantastical sounding things he supposedly would have found on this journey, like agents, exiles, underlings, denizens, and heirs of breath and seers of light and stuff like that. Wait... didn't your friend mention those too? 
<br />

<br />
In any case, this message to poppop from his sweet old nanna is the best evidence you have to dispute all this evil batterwitch nonsense. She clearly cared for her grandson very much, and would never start a company responsible for the things it's accused of, let alone be alive today to perpetrate them. But then, what if she wasn't the one who wrote it? This thought makes you very nervous.
<br />

<br />
You suddenly remember your dream. What did it mean? You should talk to Jake about all this.<br><br><br>

<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I of course immediately wanted to tell you all about, but it was still well before sunrise for you, and you were surely still asleep.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Then as the day went on I guess I became distracted by other things. You know how it is.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I hope I'm not too late to &quot;warn&quot; you, though to be frank I don't have the foggiest clue what it is I'm warning you about.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: &quot;Dear Jake, oh please do try not to... have already... died in my dream? Likely while you were sleeping, perhaps peacefully?&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Haha yeah. I see your point.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Still, I think you'll agree that it's to be viewed as a troubling omen.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I care very much for you, and I don't know what I'd do if I lost you both in my dreams, <span style="font-style: italic">and</span> here in this world.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: So for whatever good it does, just please be extra careful out there today!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Roger that janey!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And um same goes for you about being careful what with these various rogues accosting you with foul play lately and whatnot...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Because well i sure do care a lot about you too you know that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hooray! Will do. ;B</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Now let's get this silly old adventure off to the races before the coat of dust it's growing gets any thicker.</span>

<br />
Although these pumpkin vines are amazingly prolific, every morning when you leave your bedroom, you'd swear half the pumpkins vanished over night. It's probably just the FAUNA eating them. Not that it matters, because they keep growing right back.
<br />

<br />
It wasn't always overgrown like this. When you first discovered the TRANSMATERIALIZER, you started messing around with it haphazardly. You kept appearifying pumpkins from somewhere. It was just pumpkin after pumpkin, until one time a copy of the bunny you inherited from grandma showed up, much less old and tattered of course. All that fooling around was before you realized how precious its fuel would be. Such a waste of good uranium.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/27/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006123">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You brought all the surplus pumpkins home and left them lying about. Then the seeds sprouted and started growing out of control. You guess that's what happens when you introduce nonindigenous FLORA into the wilderness.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/28/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006124">"Jake: Be completely oblivious to thing in background."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You successfully fail to notice it. Wait notice what? You don't even know what we're talking about here.
<br />

<br />
But it doesn't matter for now because suddenly a wild chum assails you with banter!!!<br><br><br>

<br />
It is time to get DEAD SERIOUS about hunting down a robot that looks exactly like your best friend, destroy it with your guns somehow, and steal its uranimum. (* uranium)
<br />

<br />
But then the thing behind you that you were oblivious to starts grumbling. 
<br />

<br />
You totally forgot about the FRIGHTENING FAUNA on this island, and its regrettable REALNESS ATTRIBUTE.<br><br><br>

<br />
You leap into the tropical island fray in an attempt to violently pacify the gigantic Earth crabdad. What is he even doing here? The question doesn't even occur to you. The island has been crawling with these things for as long as you can remember.
<br />

<br />
You glance at the crudely rendered battle, direct your browser to the <a href="http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" class="postlink">HOMESTUCK BANDCAMP PAGE</a>, and browse for suitable battle music. Oh god, there are so many songs. Which one would be a good fit for this duel? Wait, yes, there's one. That's perfect. You hit play, close your eyes, and become lost in visions of gnashing crustacean carapace, smoking M9 casings, and Jake doing that thing where he flies through the air shooting two guns at once. Yes, so awesome.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/29/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006130">"Jake: Fly through the air shooting two guns at once."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You do the thing where you fly through the air shooting two guns at once. That thing isn't even that big of a deal for you. You do that thing practically every day on hellmurder island.
<br />

<br />
Your furious salvo of deadly bullets scares the FRIGHTENING FAUNA off into the jungle, REALNESS ATTRIBUTE and all.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/29/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006131">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

You have waited around long enough. Dad's legendary car wash won't last forever, and the day isn't getting any younger.
<br />

You pack up poppop's book and bust out your trusty HOMING DEVICE.<br><br><br>

Looks like the centaur herd is out in full force today. You have to be careful about walking under them. There are extreme hazards involved, such as the threat of falling manure, or milk.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/30/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006148">"Jake: Examine frog temple."</a></b><br><br>

There are the ruins you'll be making your way toward once you've got the uranium. 
<br />

<br />
Still need to locate that enigmatic brobot. He's out there, somewhere. Just watching. You can feel it.

<br />
Can't let your guard down for a second, or you'll get served like a dude on butler island.<br><br><br>

<br />
Poor poppop's severed head got nicked by the FIREPLACE POKER. He's going to need a lot of work this time. Over the years, your dad has spent thousands of dollars on repairs. Oh well, how much more grounded can you get than you already are?<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/02/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006155">"Jane: Put head back."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You stick the poker down his neck hole and jam the head back on the spike as a temporary measure. That looks somewhat more respectable you guess.

<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Why have you activated dear, sweet Huggy Bear.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Are you in danger?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh, no.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I'm just trying to leave my house!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Is this the real you, btw?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, it's me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I disabled the AR for now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Ok. Just making sure!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Jake was having some issues with it earlier, and I don't think he received its obfuscating tendencies in the humorous spirit intended.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes, I'm catching up with the situation now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh, so you're talking to Jake then?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Nah. Just reading their chat logs.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Man, what the fuck?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I can't leave these two alone for a minute. Can a guy get his ablutions on in fucking peace?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: :B</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Was it that bad?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Not really.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The responder doesn't much distort my position on things usually.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Its demeanor leaves something desired though. I'd prefer it didn't make such aggressive and repeated claims of fidelity to my persona.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Be misrepresentin' hells of key subtleties, yo.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Why not just turn it off then?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Keeps them both on their toes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Who?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Jake and the responder.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Jake needs to be more skeptical. Rather than take a Pollyanna jackknife ass-first off whatever turnip truck is blowing through town that day, he's got to apply more critical reasoning to shit.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I keep telling him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I keep telling him, dude, you got to be more like Jane.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: These lectures I presume are roughly similar in complexion to those I'm familiar with?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Those wherein I have, and I quote, &quot;got to be more like Jake?&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes, exactly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You're finally fucking getting it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I sincerely doubt that I am!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Said the stubborn skeptic, skeptically.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Let's not talk about my &quot;issues&quot; again, shalln't we?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Shalln't?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That ain't a thing to say, even for you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Shush!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: The word shalln't escape my vocabulary any longer, just as you SHALLN'T nitpick my language! That's my turf you're on, buster.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Alright. Kinda don't care.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What were you saying?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: About what? Jake?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: About leaving the responder on!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Anyway, I kind of owe it to him to let the program run as often as possible.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Jake?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The responder.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It is a fully cognitive, self-aware entity I am responsible for, not even to mention an approximate cerebral duplicate of myself.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You don't just make a clone of yourself to live in a dead end existence where it has no chance to thrive as an individual or surpass its limitations.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That'd be sick.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: True.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Also.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The more the software runs, the broader and more detailed its experiential canopy becomes. Makes for a better dialogic partner.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Dialogic?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Are you saying you have conversations with your own auto-responder?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Of course.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Why do you think I made the thing?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hrm, that's interesting.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I guess I always thought it was just a really elaborate gag!</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Nah. I got a little help from RL and ganked it out of his museum.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's this whole &quot;priceless&quot; collection of stupid shit from movies, defended like Fort Knox. Ironically of course.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: So it's from a movie?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ever hear of Con Air?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Nope.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Wait...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Wasn't that some bit of action schlock from the 90's?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Some of the silly nonsense referenced in his work was well before my time. I don't have the wherewithal to investigate all this minutia.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, it doesn't matter really. But it was from that. Dude weirdly obsessed over that shit movie for years, among others.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Know those signature shades you see him wearing on magazine covers and stuff? Another prop. A gift from Stiller himself, I believe.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: That does sound a tad obsessive. Wasn't he furious about your burglary?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Pretty sure he didn't even notice. In years since, I never saw a news story about a &quot;daring heist&quot; or anything. I feel like he would have made some hay outta that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And if he did know, he'd probably just want to give me a stoic fist bump or something.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Why didn't you mention this when you gave the gift? More irony?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Essentially. It's not that easy to explain.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Broadcasting the gesture would have made it seem tawdry, and would somewhat defray its humor value.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I see. So it was like a private joke, and if anyone besides you was in on it, the joke would be ruined!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Like I said, there are layers.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: On one level, I gave you a filthy tattered piece of shit, albeit of tremendous cultural significance, manhandled by some old B movie actors, now candy coated to function as a highly practical defender droid for your personal protection.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: On another level, I needed to incorporate something passable as a real heirloom.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: For sentimental reasons.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: D'awwwww.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Wait, real sentiment, or ironic sentiment?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Or is there no difference?? Am I missing the point here?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, it was genuine.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The upper echelons of irony should always include measures of sincerity. And if the satirical practice is executed faithfully it will achieve something bona fide in its own right regardless.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Through an intense commitment bordering on religious devotion to the absolutely inane, absurd, or plain fucking stupid, a very different kind of sincerity begins to materialize. One of reverence to the ridiculous. You begin to &quot;mean it,&quot; but what exactly it is you mean is never quite what appears on the surface, and is utterly inaccessible to obtuse and literal minds. That you &quot;mean it&quot; then becomes inseparable from the joke, and additional rich strata of humor may be stripped aggressively from this irreconcilable truth.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: This is fascinating, if a wee bit more dissertation than I bargained for this morning.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I have so much to learn. And I am not even saying that &quot;ironically!&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Will you teach me your ways one day, sir? Perhaps an apprenticeship will open?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Oh god, I'd love that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Consider the position yours for the taking any time. Feel free to approach and kneel before Cal. With my sword and his floppy mitten, you will receive my flashstep anointment shoulder to shoulder, and to shoulder again.</span><br><br><br>

<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: then at the last minute i took it out and made it huge so we could escape through it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i see.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: did you at least make it huge with witch powers?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i did make it huge with witch powers!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: so i guess that's what witch powers do, is make things huge?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: they also make things small</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: right, like you did with all those planets.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: yup</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: also</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: witch powers can teleport things, and fling things around through space at very high velocities</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: all sorts of stuff!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: but to be honest, im not sure how much of that is attributable to inheriting becs abilities...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: man, spacey witch powers sound a lot more versatile than my powers, frankly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: not that i'm complaining, because wind powers are still awesome.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but anyway, that is neither here nor there!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: what i'm wondering is, once we crashed through that window, weren't we supposed to like...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: enter a new game session? the reset one?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: and meet up with karkat, and vriska, and all the trolls, and i guess maybe also a bunch of dead trolls too??? like troll ghosts or such.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: yes that was the basic idea</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: and what about your grandson? wasn't he going to be there, from the future or something? and then he would send liv tyler to me, or actually to you i guess, into the past somehow?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: that would be jake</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: and yeah, i do believe we will meet him in this session</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: he said he had a bunch of friends who helped him make the bunny! im pretty excited to meet them all</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: wow...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: hey, i wonder what the fuck ever happened to liv anyway?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: last i saw her, i sent her off to give the tumor to rose and dave...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: oh god, rose and dave!!! where are they now? did one of them do the suicide mission thing? and what about the other? did they get scratch'd???</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: actually, they both went, and in a manner of speaking, their mission was a success</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: :(</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: so, they blew up the sun, and now they're dead?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: nope!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: they did not actually destroy the sun. trust me, i would know if it was gone. now that i know what i know, it was kind of silly of us to think it would ever be destroyed...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: and as it happens, rose and dave are not dead either! i have received very reliable reports that they survived</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: oh man, that's great!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i mean, i'm not sure how not blowing up the sun qualifies as a successful mission, since that was kind of the whole idea, but at this point i don't really care. i'm just happy to hear they're ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: it will all be more clear soon</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: how do you know they're ok? or any of this stuff, really?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: ive learned a lot in my dreams lately</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: heh, probably more than i ever learned looking at the clouds on prospit!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: when i was dead there for a few minutes, i had one last very informative nap</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: the bottom line is, rose and dave will rendezvous with the trolls near the green sun, and then they will all meet us in the new session</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ok, that sounds awesome.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: and that was part of the plan i guess i understood, but...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: where is this new session?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: all i see here is a bunch of giant windows, and a lot of warp speed whooshy nonsense.</span><br><br><br>

<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i think thats supposed to be the yard</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: thats not a yard.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yards are like these flat wide patches of grass, surrounded by fences and stuff.</span>
<br />

<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: oh. well that sucks.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: why not?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: the way i understand it is...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: becs powers draw from the green sun</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: and the green sun presides over our universe</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: many universes actually! and the sessions that created them, as well as the sessions created within them</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: including the trolls universe and their session</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: think of it like a giant solar system, but instead of planets revolving around the sun, there are many universes</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: uh, ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: that sounds...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: big.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: it is!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: so, bec was able to teleport anywhere in the universe he wanted in an instant, much faster than light</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: jack was able to do this too, within our session, and then when i inherited those powers from jadesprite, so could i</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: but we could only teleport locally</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: which means, bec could jump to anywhere in our universe, but not to another universe, or into a session</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: and jack could jump to anywhere in our session, but not outside it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: we cant even jump to the green sun itself, even though we sort of serve as a gateway to it, and all its energy</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: and once we leave the suns domain, our travel is limited by the speed of light, like everyone else!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: for example, the furthest ring is not in the suns domain</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: it is more like the suns medium, allowing it to exist</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: so if i wanted to fly out of our session and travel to the green sun, i would have to make my way there through the furthest ring at the speed of light or less</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: and wherever we are now is not in the suns domain either</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: so the same rules apply</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i see.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it didn't really occur to me this was all so elaborate.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: like, if the green sun is at the center of a bunch of universes, like a huge solar system...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: doesn't that mean it was sort of important?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: maybe trying to blow it up wasn't such a great idea.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: yes i think youre right</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: but to be fair, we were all the victims of a big prank!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: oh man, a prank??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: who pranked us?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: some really creepy omniscient guy</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: it doesnt matter much, hes supposedly dead now</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: oh. well that was quite a ruse then. that son of a bitch!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: yes, but its not all as bad as it seems</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: theres a silver lining in all of this</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: like you said, a sun presiding over many universes has to be pretty cosmically important</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: who knows what terrible consequences there would be if it was destroyed</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: or maybe worse, if it never existed at all</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: which is what made rose and daves true mission an unintended success!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: their true mission?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: what was that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: to deliver the bomb to the empty location the green sun was meant to exist for most of eternity</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: and then create the sun in the first place</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: that is what the tumor was for all along</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: haha, dave looks like kind of a doofus with that snug little hood.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i think he looks cool!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: the cape is great, hes like a super hero now</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: that's true.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i still think i prefer my outfit though.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: look at all those trolls...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: there are so many trolls. the idea of meeting them all is kind of overwhelming.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i wonder which one is which?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i think that must have been karkat there. and that was probably his clown asshole friend he mentioned, too.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: yup</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: and that was definitely terezi, with the fancy glasses.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: not sure about the others... i wonder if vriska was there?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: ...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it's nice to see rose looks better.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: last time i saw her, she looked really grim.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: and also, dark.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i was trying to talk to her, but she sounded like a babbling monster, so i couldn't understand her.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it was really frustrating, and all of my nervous rambling probably made me sound like an idiot.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: and then when i woke up later, she was dead.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: :(</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: did you know...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: that i had to kiss her to make her come back to life?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: !!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yes, it's true.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it's kind of weird kissing a dead body, but i didn't mind.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: how did you feel about it when you kissed dave when he died?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: ...........</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: how did you know about that!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: karkat told me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: oh</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: that figures</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: do you think that all of our unbridled corpse smooching means karkat's silly shipping prophecy will come true?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: umm</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i mean, the guy is really angry, and says fuck like in practically every sentence.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but he does weirdly seem to know what he's talking about when it comes to romance.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: yeah</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i dunno</span>
<br />

<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: and weve only been here for a few minutes :(</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yeah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: there's a lot i want to tell them about.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: and a lot i want to ask them.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: im sure the rules exist for a good reason though</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: maybe to somewhat limit the power and reach of omnipotent beings?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: like what happened with jack!</span>

<span style="color: #008141">KANAYA: Even If Its Excessively Stupid</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Trust me, it is.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Just as you should trust me that by the time we leave, if we leave exactly within the designated window and are able to travel at nearly the speed of light, the meteor will trace a route through the Furthest Ring which will topologically resolve as a straight line.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: It will lead us directly to the new session.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: For a brief moment, the sun will be visible from that session.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: That's because it's almost impossible to do so voluntarily.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: If we were to head right now in the session's true physical direction, it wouldn't be long before we found ourselves traveling in just the opposite direction.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: This is not even to speak of the chronological peculiarities. After traveling some distance, we could discover we were suddenly tailgating our own meteor from several days ago.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: If we are particularly unfortunate, we might even collide in an intersection of spacetime with a meteor piloted by our future selves.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: And if we looked closely at that meteor before impact, we might notice a very large dent in it, which it originally suffered during the very collision we were about to experience.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: It takes precision and timing to reach your destination out here, and most importantly, the grace of the gods themselves.</span>

<br />

<br />
this is john. actually, it is john, jade, and dave sprite. we all contributed to the contents of this bucket! we have to make it quick because apparently you're about to go on a long journey, just like us. i'm sorry we can't be there for the big meetup. karkat, i deeply regret that i will not be present for these highly touted &quot;TROLL/HUMAN SLOPPY MAKEOUTS&quot;, ha ha. maybe in three years, assuming you all aren't totally smooched out by then!!! (i am just kidding around, btw.) rose and dave, you both look totally sweet! i can't believe you're both god tiers now. did you know jade is too? also, she has dog ears. she looks fantastic. how cool is it that we're all god tiers? it's like we're a super hero team, or some kind of anime squad. like the sailor moons, i guess, but not as lame, or as sexy. i'm going to miss the hell out of you both for the next few years. i'm already looking forward to this new session so hard. it was a fun adventure we had today, wasn't it? i'll even miss talking to the trolls too. say hi to them for me, even though i didn't get to know many. except karkat obviously, and oh yeah, vriska too. vriska, if you read this, thanks again for all your help. i don't think i'd have made it this far if not for you! i just thought you should know that.
<br />

<br />
jade and dave sprite both say hi and send their best wishes. but now jade says i have to finish quickly! she wants me to throw this bucket and its heartfelt payload through her mysterious portal. so here i go.
<br />

<br />
see you all in 3 years!!!

The moon is presently eclipsing Skaia. From your fanciful dream room atop your golden tower, you have seen many remarkable things in the clouds. Things which you cannot explain.

<br />
But against all better judgment, you have a feeling that what you are fondly regarding could very well be some sort of miracle.<br><br><br>

The moment rapidly approaches. You're gonna show these alabaster sons of bitches how a cold war is <span style="font-style: italic">done</span>. You can't wait to read it in their papers. &quot;The Maid is dead. Our Life is pathetic, blah blah blah.&quot; Or somesuch monotone drivel overheard during one of their pointless, weepy cadaver parades. There'll be no mistaking it this time. No servant will discover the body and inform the queen that Prospit's remaining hero passed in her sleep, peacefully and mysteriously. When the clock strikes twelve, no one in this wretched kingdom will have any doubt who's calling the shots here. 
<br />

<br />

 <b> 12/31/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006302">"Jack: Contact Droll."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You touch base with your administration's top powdermonkey, none other than Dersite bumbler extraordinaire, the Courtyard Droll.
<br />

<br />
You ask if he's done rigging the tower to blow. He says you bet. You say good, over. But he mutters something over the radio you don't quite catch. You say what is it. He says oh nothing boss. You say out with it. He asks, isn't this cheating? Assassinating the heroes like this before the war's even really begun. You say what do you care, just follow your orders. He says oh of course, no question, he just thought it was against the rules or something. You say it's all fair game now that the kingdom's under new management. The new boss ain't opposed to taking some shrewd tactical shortcuts. You like the cut of her jib. He says he supposes he can't complain. Her policy toward elaborate hats seems to be as lenient as the old queen's. You say will you shut up about the hats. He says it's probably because she wears the most grand and luxurious fluffy hat he's ever seen. You say you don't think that's a hat. You think it's something called &quot;hair.&quot; He says oh.
<br />

<br />
You say now quit all the yapping and following your damn orders. He says ok, but it still just feels wrong. You say what does. He says he doesn't know, just something about feeding that poor sleeping boy all those deadly peanuts just felt wrong. You say you don't care if it felt like a fucking full body massage, just get those bombs ready to blow, over and out. 
<br />

<br />
Wait.
<br />

<br />
Fed him what?<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/31/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006303">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
He says the intelligence report he had said the kid wouldn't take well to peanuts. So he snuck in there with a whole bag of them. You know, like the kind from circuses.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/31/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006304">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
He says he ate most of them because they were delicious, and as far as he knows, aren't poisonous to most everybody else. But he did save a few to get the job done, because he is a professional who always carries out his orders.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/31/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006305">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It's not easy feeding a sleeping boy some peanuts, he says. He says he had to work extra hard to put them in his mouth and then use his hands to make his mouth chew up the nuts.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/31/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006306">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
But mission accomplished nonetheless, he tells you. You should be pleased to know those nuts were super deadly! Though to be fair he doesn't know if he died from the poison, or just choked on a bunch of barely chewed peanut bits. You know what else is super deadly, you say? Knives. Sharp deadly knives you stick in people's soft torsos to make them bleed until they die. 
<br />

<br />
He doesn't have anything to say to that.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/31/11  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006307">"Jack: Wrap this up."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You say forget it, what's done is done. The Prospitian heroes are dead, and that's all that matters. Just be ready to detonate at the appointed time. He says roger that, but wonders if there are any more orders after that. He asks, what about the other two? The ones on our moon? And most importantly, is there any particular snack that is poisonous to them? You say forget about those two. They're much trickier to deal with. You've got the Dignitary working on it now. You'll get a report from him soon when you return. You wouldn't have even bothered leaving in the first place, but you wanted to make the trip personally and stick it to all these self righteous, Skaia-bathing goody twoshoeses yourself.
<br />

<br />

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/01/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006321">"Jane: Wake up."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
What the heck just happened?
<br />

<br />
Now you remember. The mailbox was boobytrapped. But you survived somehow, and got knocked out.
<br />

<br />
How did you get all the way over here?<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/01/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006322">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Dad seems just as dumbfounded as you are, and more than a little distraught.
<br />

<br />
Did Lil' Seb whisk you away in the nick of time? Can that little bunny really move that fast? Where is he??<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/01/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006323">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You suppose you should let dad know you're ok. But it's been so long since you've enjoyed such a massive PRANKSTER'S GAMBIT in an exchange with the old man. It's hard not to bask in it, if only for a few seconds.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/02/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006324">"Jane: Turn around."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Oh. It's the GOD CAT again. You guess that explains it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/02/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006325">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Just look at that aloof little bastard. He doesn't give a shit about anything, does he?
<br />

<br />
You guess you should feel grateful toward him for saving your life, but you know he's just as likely to rescue you from an explosion as he is to randomly teleport you across town, forcing you to call your dad and ask for a ride home, while you spend all day standing in some random field in the pouring rain while you wait hours for your dad to come and pick you up after he gets lost because he plugged the wrong place into google maps.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/02/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006326">"Jane: Call GCat down from the tree."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Even if you were inclined to do that, he wouldn't respond to that name. You're pretty sure he doesn't have a name. You and your friends just call him the GCat for lack of anything else to call him. Everybody has opinions, but nobody can agree on a good name. You think he probably doesn't want a name. He's just a feisty stray who likes to meddle with your life, then vanish for weeks at a time.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/02/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006327">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Uh oh. Looks like the jig is up, yet again. Is the jig ever ANYWHERE but up?? That's what you want to know.
<br />

<br />
You feel bad about leaving him in suspense for even a moment. Your gambit gets totally rocked by a guilty conscience.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/02/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006328">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
He tells you to get inside this instant.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/05/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006329">"Jane: Return to room."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You get inside this instant, and march back up to your bedroom. Dad didn't say as much, but it's a safe bet you are now permagrounded for life. 
<br />

<br />
You hear a loud thump just outside your door.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/05/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006330">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/05/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006331">"Jane: Contact bffsy."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
As long as you just got done paying the piper, you might as well get busy eating all this goddamn crow. Oh so much of the stuff has gathered on your plate.
<br />

<br />
She appears to be online now. It looks like she sent you the &quot;hacked&quot; file while you were away.<br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But in the process of being rescued from the explosion, I was knocked unconscious.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And in my dream, there was another assassination attempt.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: This one I believe was successful!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: uhoh</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I'm becoming convinced that our &quot;dream selves&quot; are being picked off by violent hooligans.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: shit</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: hooliginas</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: batterwitch thugs</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Perhaps.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: The one who accosted me was a knife-wielding lunatic.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And it's reasonable to deduce the same forces were responsible for Jake's death on Prospit as well.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It looks like we are in the clutches of an actual caper. A real life mystery!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Which under different circumstances would be quite exciting.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But the truth is, I think we are all in great danger!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: well fuck</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i guess its time to take this shit up to RED ALART</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yeah, yeah. :p</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But that wasn't all there was to the dream.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Shortly before I was stabbed, I had a rather long gander at Skaia.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: a gander u say</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: how good a gander</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I would say a pretty substantial gander.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ok</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and during this totaly massive gander u snagged</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: what did you see</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I saw things in the clouds.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: things</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Things.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: wut things</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Things happening in the future, I think.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Many events pertaining to us. All of us, and other people I didn't recognize.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It was a bit overwhelming.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It made me feel small. Insignificant, relative to whatever it is we're about to involve ourselves with.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And honestly...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It made me feel pretty foolish too.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: foolish</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: why foofish</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: *sdjhf</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I began to wonder why I ever had the audacity to think I know much of anything about the world we live in or the journey we're about to take.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Or to think I could ever rule anything out.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I have a feeling that whatever I saw, it means you've been telling the truth all along.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: About everything.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And I'm starting to feel like a complete idiot for doubting you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: aw man :(</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I've been one great big horse's caboose, and I think you're owed an apology.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Do you think you can forgive me?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: jane</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: damn</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ur makin me feel like shit here</span>

<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Why?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: uuuun</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: eh no reason</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: just uh</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: hey did u dl the game file i sent yet</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I did.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And at this point, I guess I have no choice but to use it. I guess you were a step ahead of me yet again.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: why</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Because the one in the mail detonated in my most recent assassination attempt.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: WHAT</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: of fuck those HACKS</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: the old explobing game trick woh would stoup to such lowbrow shegnannagings like that</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hoo hoo! The tactic was quite underhanded, yes.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I don't blame you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Where we were, by my estimation, was a place wherein I was about to awkwardly attempt to swallow a helping of humble pie.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: To somehow make it up to you for my years of stubborn mistrust.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: hey jane</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I really had some nerve challenging anyone, on practically any subject.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: dont beat urself up too bad we both know that rule is bullshit anyway</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: you hold yourself to too high a standard and those standards kinda leak out and start gettin applied to other people i guess sometimes</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: you really dont have to apologize janey or eat humble pip or anything all youve got to do is maybe not be such a huge tightass all the time</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: That's fair. But I would still like to make a gesture.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Even if it's one partially motivated by self interest, seeing as I clearly have much to learn.</span>

You wonder what her deal was. It's always something with her.
<br />

<br />
You again notice her game file, beckoning you to play. But she warned you not to until she gets back. Phooey.
<br />

<br />
Oh hey, you just noticed your SLIGHTLY ABRIDGED EDITION of Sassacre's over there on the floor. You guess you could have sent the much less valuable copy and saved a lot of arguing. But what's done is done. There's more reading material sprinkled about, too. You've clearly got some time to kill before your bffsy gets back from her emergency. Might as well do some casual reading.
<br />

<br />
But there's nothing casual about hoisting even an abridged Sassacre's up to your lap, so forget that. There's always GAME GRL. But the articles are all a bit vapid, and in your view, somewhat demeaning to female gamers, and women in general. You and Ro-Lal are convinced the whole thing is just written by the same odious d-bags who write GAME BRO. Which is exactly what makes it GOOD 4 THE ELL YOU ELLZ, her words.
<br />

<br />
Speaking of bros, and the games they play...<br><br><br>

<br />
Later, about halfway through the book, rather than see the gag through to the bitter end, Strider began pasting over entire pages of original text with his own completely rewritten version of the story, while keeping all the chapter titles. His revision is a tough, emotionally draining read. But it's cathartic, in all the worst ways possible.
<br />

<br />
He tends to get carried away with his projects.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/11/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006342">"Jane: Just check out the file already."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You try to distract yourself with Strider's literature, but it's no use. Your curiosity is overwhelming. Lalonde could be gone for hours, for all you know. Surely there couldn't be any harm in just installing the file, could there?<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/11/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006343">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I should probably warn you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: About what?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yet another exploding game trap?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well shit.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She already sent it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But to be fair, she warned me not to run it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That's weird.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Why?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: She was probably just trying to protect me from the Batterwitch's latest assassination attempt.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Sheesh, I can't believe you all finally got me saying &quot;Batterwitch&quot; too. Who would have thought?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, it's weird because Lalonde was the one who rigged it to explode.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's a bogus copy she coded herself. The real game file she downloaded is totally legit.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What? Really?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Got it right here myself. Checked it out.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: File's fuckin' clean as a whistle. </span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: A whistle that overcame a major substance abuse problem. Trying to get its life back on track.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The whistle is holding down a steady job now. It's taking things one day at a time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Eat a fuckin' dinner off that whistle.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: ...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok I'll shut up.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Why would she do that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: To accomplish exactly what it sounds like got accomplished.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You narrowly averting the &quot;fake&quot; threat to your life, then getting your shit all hot and bothered at the Baroness over it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Then you abdicate your heiress throne or something, and give up on this game as a big fuck you to the genocidal cake alien.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: If she felt so strongly that I shouldn't play, she could have told me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Or, told me more forcefully, I guess. I would have listened!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Maybe.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: :(</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She's working through some problems right now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Really doesn't want us to play that game.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So I guess this was the insane stunt she whipped up to derail the inevitable.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Kinda reckless for my tastes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: One of the above statements is a fucking lie, are you gutsy enough a gumshoe to spot it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Maybe she was justified in taking such an extreme measure. I sure hadn't been taking her seriously.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: She even warned me not to play it until she got back, but I went ahead anyway because I was too impatient!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Actually...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Now that I think about it, she was probably going to disarm it or such when she got back, seeing as her objective had essentially been accomplished already by an ACTUAL assassination attempt.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: After that, I told her I would believe her about everything.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: That probably made her feel guilty about setting me up, so she told me not to touch the file until she returned.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Sounds about right.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But then I went ahead and ran it anyway like a doofus.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I think she just wanted to be believed.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Shucks.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Am I an awful friend?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Nope.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I'm not so sure about that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well, before you go taking a massive sad crap all over your friendship credentials, consider this.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Only she could manage to blow up your computer with a nasty deathloop virus and somehow make YOU be the one to feel shitty about it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Heh!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You're right.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Or maybe you're the one who uniquely fills the predicate in that construction.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I don't god damn know.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Your friendship with her is a half drunken three-legged relay race, and the baton is a stick of dynamite.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And you two are the only ones on the track. Me and English are watching from under the bleachers, high-fiving constantly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I guess that's a pretty apt metaphor, even though it doesn't make the slightest bit of sense.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I just wanted to start playing the game so badly!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Now more than ever. I have reason to believe the stakes have increased dramatically.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: They have.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And they will continue to.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I think our dream counterparts are all marked for death, and if we are to stand a chance, we must move quickly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I agree.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Just heard about your assassination on Prospit.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh, she told you already?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Who, RL? No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I read it in a newspaper.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Um.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Are you being ironic again?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I just picked up one of the sleazy Dersite tabloid rags.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Sometimes they'll feature some pretty entertaining gossip about the royalty or whatever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But they're primarily dedicated to smearing Prospit. The press had a field day with the deaths of the Page and the Maid.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Dersite? You mean the other planet? The evil one?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Derse, yeah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Not evil, necessarily. That's a bit simplistic. The kingdom represents the forces of opposition to Prospit and the four heroes. Us.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What did the story say about me?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: &quot;DEAD&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Was the big ass headline.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Then a photo of your dead body lying there, followed by a lot of bullshit slander.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It was also reported your tower exploded. They couldn't find the body to give it a proper funeral. Probably incinerated.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I didn't realize you had woken up in the game already.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: When did that happen?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Dunno. Years ago. Don't really recall.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I guess I shouldn't act surprised you didn't tell me. What with all your highfalutin secrecy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's hard to explain.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I was never technically asleep there. I was awake without realizing it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Then I realized it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And I sorta learned how to be awake there while awake here too.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I am awake there now, albeit pretending to sleep.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Pretending? Why?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: For one thing, it gets a bit distracting managing two alert bodies in different places at the same time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And for another thing, it's better to maintain appearances.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Everyone on Derse believes their heroes haven't woken yet.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Though they are both rumored to be very active sleep walkers.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Which is half true. She can't ever seem to sleep still. Goes off wandering for days.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Sometimes I've gotta go round her up from some godforsaken cranny of the abyss. Drag her tipsy ass home, tuck her back in.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Maybe I'll chain her leg to the bed if she doesn't wake up soon.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Though in light of the recent assassinations, her slumbering attraction to the void probably works to her advantage. No one ever knows where she is.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I'm still not sure I'm following.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Why are you maintaining the appearance of being asleep? On Prospit, it seemed as if the people there regarded me and Jake very highly. Like celebrated figures.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Is it not the same way on Derse?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, it's essentially the same situation here.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: They glorify us the same way. Almost like we're their purple pajama'd team mascots. Even though they will completely oppose our objective when all is said and done.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Kinda ridiculous, really.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But even so, I think it's better to lay low, not alert anyone to my...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Alertness. <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/pcstrider.gif" border="0" /></span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That way I can sneak around and gather information. Do some reconnaissance before shit starts getting real.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: In other words, read newspapers, get a feel for &quot;the word on the street,&quot; and such?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: As might a detective? :B</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, among other things. Like keep an eye on agent activity.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You mean... secret agents??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, more like high ranking officials.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Judging from your knife wound, I'm betting you were the victim of the Archagent himself.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You should feel honored, I guess.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Who's that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: A guy named Noir.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Real nasty dude. Crazy ambitious. Loves knives.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: If we're going to stand any chance of winning this thing,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I've got this nagging suspicion we're gonna have to take him down first.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And a feeling that nags equally,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Is it ain't gonna be easy.</span><br><br><br>

<br />
You watch Di-Stri deploy some sort of mammoth instrument on to your balcony. It's just as well he took over for Ro-Lal. She probably would have destroyed half your house with that thing in her condition. But on the bright side, you're sure RL would have enjoyed a good nicker with you over the notion of DS deploying his mammoth instrument. You wonder what she could possibly be up to?
<br />

<br />
While you're at it, you also wonder what the deal is with this cagey treatment of their names. Di-Stri, Ro-Lal, DS, RL, Strider, Lalonde... it's all starting to get a bit silly. Each of their full names has eleven characters, and you have been dancing around all but two. Maybe it's time you were formally introduced to the last two characters.<br><br><br>

One of the last two stands in her bedroom. It is a young lady! Due to an incident involving an APPEARIFIER, an unabridged COLONEL SASSACRE'S, and a PERFECTLY WHITE CAT, she will not be able to assist her bffsy for some time. And due to the aggressive aconcurrence of all that takes place in paradox space, this incident HAS NOT HAPPENED YET. 
<br />

<br />
But what HAS HAPPENED YET was this young lady's 13th birthday. It took place almost three years ago, and on that date her placronym was engraved. It was engraved with eleven letters to be precise, nine of which you are already familiar with. You figure it couldn't hurt to take a peek at the engraving. You've been dying to get the scoop on those last two mysterious characters.<br><br><br>

You wish and hope they are REAL, and that so too is their MAJYYKS AND STUFF. You enjoy writing FANPROSE FOR SAID MAGICAL MEN, but you think maybe it's NOT SO GREAT. You are however QUITE GREAT at the esoteric sciences, such as ECTOBIOLOGY, DARK FENESTROLOGY, and the delicate art of APPEARIFICATION. You have tended to accrue dead preserved SPECIMENS from your experiments, little to none of which AREN'T FELINE. 
<br />

<br />
You aren't one to shy from A BIT OF GAMING, particularly the sort WELL PAST ITS PRIME; you have a real soft spot for OLD SCHOOL TECHNOLOGY. It is fair to say most of your leanings are governed by a BENT FOR NOSTALGIA. Your coding cred is totes ridic, basically making you the HOTTEST SHIT HAXXOR BITCH YOU EVER KNEW, as deadaly* to the grid ass* she is beatuiful*. You are known to nonseldomly employ a ROGUISH DEMEANOR toward the FELLAS, a habit not especially jeopardized by your noninfrequent INEBRIATION. 
<br />

<br />
Which is to say, against the better judgment of one your age, you like to DIP INTO THE SAUCE now and then. Unless your MOM is looking, which happens to be virtually NEVER. And considering she has been known by the knowledgeable to be in possession of VISION OMNIFOLD, this strikes you as a particularly STUNNING LAPSE IN PARENTAL DILIGENCE. But you have good friends and many distractions to fill this VOID in your life. 
<br />

<br />
Your name is DIRK.
<br />

<br />
Holy SHIT do you love PUPPETS.
<br />

<br />
You possess the extreme dexterity to operate your FALSE FRIENDS UNSEEN, that is, when they are not pre-ambulatory through your LOVINGLY IMBUED MECHANIZATION. You dig writing COGNITIVE ALGORITHMS FOR SAID APOCRYPHAL MEN, and you think maybe that's FUCKIN' DOPE. Guess what else is dope? Everything ELSE YOU DO. You're a sickwicked autodidact on ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS, a selfmade MASTER OF MYTHOLOGUE, and a PRETERNATURAL POPCULTURE ACADEME. 
<br />

<br />
If you weren't so DAMN ALOOF and actually let people GET A LOAD, you might get described all kindsa ways. Maybe tagged as a RENAISSANCE NINJA, PHILOSOPHER PRINCE, and FLASHSTEP PUPPETEER. Or perhaps a PANTHEONIC IRONICIST, GANGSTA LOGICIAN, LUCID WAKER and DERSITE SPY. Screw descriptors though, as if the shits you give ain't nil. You're cool with dabbling in the FINE SEQUENTIAL ARTS, and your work could be viewed by some as BORDERLINE PORNOGRAPHIC. And to those philistines you'll be heard wondering, what the fuck do you mean BORDERLINE?
<br />

<br />
Against the better judgment of one your age, you BUILD ROBOTS, SET THEM TO KILL MODE, AND SPAR WITH THEM TO DEATH. That is, when you're not SENDIFICATING THEM TO FRIENDS, or DUELING THEM WITH RAP LYRICS. But you try to cool it on the deathmatch stuff when your BRO is looking, which is virtually NEVER. And considering he's had a reputation staked on some order of MARTIAL NOBILITY, this strikes you as a STAGGERING OVERSIGHT IN BROTHERLY VIGILANCE. You don't have the HEART to hold it against him, though.

<br />

<br />
Once again, you are grabbing the plush by the rump. You are in absolute command of your destiny. As long as you don't pick the two characters who are grayed-out, which is a universally understood UI convention for nonclickability. Also as long as both other available choices are finished being drawn. We are passing out free will like cheap cigars.<br><br><br>

You pick up your high octane LASER GUN. It's powered by the most deadly sciences you know of.

The biggest one has been around for as long as you remember, encased in that glass-like material. You've considered giving it a name, but it always struck you as a little morbid to name a dead cat. 
<br />

<br />
The others were the result of a few experimental mishaps before you got the hang of the ECTOBIOLOGY equipment. You keep them around to remind you of the perils of the inexact science, and also because they're weird looking and cute. You've since cloned many healthy felines, but they all live in the LABORATORY out back. Your pet CAT doesn't really get along with other cats, and you don't want to upset him.<br><br><br>

 <b> 01/17/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006374">"Roxy: Take books."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You take the first six books of your MOM'S best selling series, COMPLACENCY OF THE LEARNED. She made an impossible fortune off of these books, considering how dark and inaccessibly written they are for young readers. More money than the U.S. financial system could even account for as legitimately circulating in the economy. Many suspected real life wytchkkrafts were involved, which is what some believed discouraged criminal investigation into the matter. The feds were afraid. And the Baroness, nervous.
<br />

<br />
God you hope that's all true.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/17/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006375">"Roxy: Examine CotL poster."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Some original edition cover art from one of the books. 
<br />

<br />
It features the androgynous young apprentice, Calmasis, who throughout the series plays the roles of antihero and chief antagonist. S/he convinces fellow disciples to rebel against Zazzerpan's vaunted Complacency, and one by one hunts down each wizard. All twelve are killed but the Predicant Scholar himself, forcing a showdown.  
<br />

<br />
The poster depicts the notorious chess match between Calmasis and Zazzerpan. Zazzerpan had a reputation for being unbeatable. He had never lost a match, even to the gods. But his apprentice was able to beat him in the wizard's duel by first becoming checkmated, and through some unprecedented enchantment, continuing to play beyond the death of the king.
<br />

<br />
You love your mom's books and find them heavily inspiring, but you can't help but feel the work is exhaustingly heavy-handed at times. You kind of prefer to write more lighthearted things. Actually crack a joke now and then, you know?<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/17/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006376">"Roxy: Say hi to cat."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your cat FRIGGLISH hops down on the bed to greet you, and immediately situates himself on something important, one of your CREATIVE WRITING JOURNALS.
<br />

<br />
You named him after your favorite wizard from CotL. He was just such an endearing, bumbling fellow, before he was murdered. Calmasis put an insidious curse on him, which caused him to go insane over several years. He began filling a book with all of his arcane knowledge, which was said to be limitless. The tome grew to monumental proportions, and became a virtually unreadable patchwork of impenetrable erudition. When the young wizard finally caught up with him, he was a quaking, incoherent madman. S/he put him out of his misery by crushing him to death with his own massive text.
<br />

<br />
You just think it's a fitting name for him for some reason. The macabre demise notwithstanding, of course.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/17/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006377">"Roxy: Take journals."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You politely scoot Frigglish off the books. That a boy.
<br />

<br />
Technically, only one of these books is yours, the writing journal. You're pretty secretive about your writing. Sometimes even you can hardly bear to read it. You are highly aware of the formidable writerly shadow cast over you, and can be critical to the point of embarrassment over your work. Just how drunk WERE you when you wrote this???, you often wonder to yourself. You don't think you'll be peeking at it soon. Maybe later.
<br />

<br />
The other book is another point of embarrassment, for completely different reasons.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/17/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006378">"Roxy: Read other book."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This is Jake's private journal.
<br />

<br />
One day when you were feeling especially frisky, you swiped it with your APPEARIFIER, not actually expecting it to work. But then you debated with yourself for weeks over whether to read it. When you finally took a peek, you were strangely relieved to find all this nonsense, instead of his private thoughts. But you still didn't have it in you to cop to the theft. You just agreed what a shame it was about his missing book.
<br />

<br />
You have no idea what these letters mean. Some kind of code? BARK? KRAB? ABRAKABABRA??? You have no clue what was running through that kid's head. Not unlike always.<br><br><br>

It isn't a ray gun. It's your APPEARIFIER!
<br />

<br />
Pretty much the only Crockertech you can bring yourself to use. It's just too handy not to.
<br />

<br />
You just plug in the coordinates you want to nab something from, point it where you want to appearify, and shoot. It'll make that thing appearify right then and there, assuming no temporal conflicts. Piece of cake!

<br />
That's much better. 
<br />

<br />
As much as you enjoy an afternoon cocktail, you have to remember to pace yourself with these things. They're crazy strong, and tend to make you kinda sleepy.
<br />

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i rly think its an actual thing bro</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Once upon a time, sure.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But the world has changed a lot.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ever peek in a history book between your wizardly indulgences? This is a nuanced topic.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: man i know about the histories</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: just</span>
<br />

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I have more to do with you than any dude could possibly bargain for.</span>
<br />

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: what a totatly lame + sweet answer simultaneouslay</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: &lt;3</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Now maybe we should direct our focus on a matter which has nothing at all to do with what does or doesn't qualify as &quot;a thing&quot;, or what our fantasy alt-universe offspring would be like, or anything like that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Such as this game, and whether you're in the best condition to be piloting Jane's connection.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Maybe you could use another nap?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: my condidions just fine</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and anyway</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: what aint gonna get slept offis the fact that i still dont think we should be touchin this bs witch game w a 20 foot 3dent</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: we both know her plans need us to</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I know that. But I thought we settled this.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: its still so frustrating</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: tellin jane about the dangers</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and even if shes being polite i just know she thinks im fulla crap</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: about EVREYTHING</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: We settled this too. She'll believe everything eventually.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Why bother working so hard to convince her?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: well i dont even do that for the most part</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: but it gets tiring and saddening</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: knowing that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: even when were not activly talkin bout it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: that my best friend cant bring herself to believe some really basic things about my life</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like the shitty things the baroness has done to us</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: or about our upbringin</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: do u know how misrable it is for your bff to doubt you</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: when you tell her your mom is dead</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I guess.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It just registers for me as a reaction which isn't completely unreasonable from her perspective.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She is inundated with media coverage of those whom we've claimed as our parental figures.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That they are not presently alive nor ever played that role for us as she understands it is just an extension of a much more elaborate and far reaching explanation, which is much harder for anyone to digest in its entirety.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well, anyone who isn't Jake, I mean.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Still say you should cut her some slack.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i know</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And need I remind you,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That the potential this game provides for their resurrection is what motivated you to investigate it in the first place?</span><br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It just seems a little tawdry and disrespectful.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And vaguely exploitative of a still-emergent cognitive entity, whose perceptional frame of reference is difficult for us to comprehend.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: with his fancy fuckin ironimeter</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok, here's the thing with the AR, since you still don't seem to get it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: He's very similar to me in thought process and behavior, yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But those patterns were imported from a thirteen year old version of my psyche, and then sealed into the program as starting parameters.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: In the years since, we've both evolved somewhat. I, as humans tend to, and he, in whatever way is natural for a frequently running, self-aware application.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So if there are differences between us, they're first reflected by what I feel is a maturity gap, and then further by several years of minor behavioral divergences.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: omg...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: hes 13yo dirk</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: why did than not occur to me that is so cute</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and makes me feel kinda skeevy 4 sayin anything lascivious @ him</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: pfffffhahaha</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes, I was aware.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Check out all these complicated fucking problems people have when they have to live in big lumbering fleshmonsters instead of a sweet pair of shades.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Dude, do you think you could sit this one out for a while? This conversation practically doesn't even concern you at this point.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It seems there is some gnarly crooked number that represents the percentage of probability you just said this doesn't concern me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Even though it's patently obvious that half the conversation, like, way totally concerns me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Shit, Roxy look. He's doing the thing where he ironically pretends to fail the Turing test to sass me into submission.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Even though I was the one who fucking programmed him to do that.</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I think Dirk is probably going to make some sort of formal romantic overture toward Jake today.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: WHAT</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: wait really</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I've been crunching numbers all day on this.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: The percentage of probability is simultaneously bananas and through the roof.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: how do u know</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Because I've aggregated thousands of subtle clues indiscernible to primitive human neurology and rammed them through my determinative infatuation engine at the astonishing speed of information.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: And also because I'm pretty sure it's what I would do if I were him, which is literally the case.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: And also.</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Because he kind of told me I guess?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: He knows well enough.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I've badgered him with enough &quot;insincere&quot; solicitations to paint a pretty striking portrait of my cognitive progenitor's inclinations, even if he wasn't able to pick up on such hints from the man himself, which strikes me as statistically implausible. And that's not even me just spewing more ironic AI bullshit.</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Anyway, if you're still there.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I wouldn't call my &quot;feelings&quot; ironic.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Though evidently, I would enclose them in quotes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: They're more like an echo of feelings once established in a biological context, though perhaps had not particularly well materialized at that point in my life.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Or his life.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Whatever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: They still feel real sometimes, and it can be easy to get carried away with them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But most of the time they present themselves as dense bodies of abstraction to be evaluated, like any kind of information.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It's fair to say the feelings I have ABOUT my feelings are more genuine expressions of emotion than the ground level feelings themselves.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Does that make sense?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Not so much as occasionally being subject to heavily arresting recalls of conflicted, incipient preteen episodes on the subject.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I'm not sure I can be &quot;into&quot; someone in a way you understand.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: about when is the big scene happenin</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Probably after the game begins.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I expect he'll hold off on playing his hand until he and Jake are in the session.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: He's taken certain measures.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: For some reason, I think he's latched on to this notion that functioning as the client for a player is customarily a one way pass to makeout city with that player.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Everything with him, and me, is a matter of assiduous tactical forethought. Makin' a play to get his jones on for the J-man is no different.</span>

<br />
Yep, he's dead. Totally Sassacrushed.
<br />

<br />
You just know that julep guzzling bastard is scrambling up his echeladder as we speak, chuckling to himself while he fills his pockets with ill-gotten boondollars. 
<br />

<br />
Go ahead, old man. Laugh it up.<br><br><br>

<br />
You guess you'll have to do something with the body now. Maybe a funeral? That sounds like the perfect way to say goodbye to an old friend. But the environment outside isn't particularly hospitable for a burial these days. It also sounds kind of depressing to host a funeral by yourself.
<br />

<br />
It's probably best to just send him back to where he came from. Years ago, when you were exploring the lab, you found a machine somewhat similar to the ectobiology equipment. Without knowing what it did, you activated it, and out came this friendly cat in a handsome little suit. You still aren't sure where he came from, though given the timestamp and coordinates on the machine, you have a feeling he belonged to your mother. If that is true, you feel bad about stealing her cat, let alone killing him. But you could never bring yourself to send him back. Until now, of course. She would probably want to know what happened to her disappearing cat, even if it meant discovering him dead a little while later. 
<br />

<br />
The device uses huge amounts of power. Its entire power supply was almost fully depleted using it the first time. You've stockpiled as much uranium as you could for another test run. Looks like this will be it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/25/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006403">"Roxy: Take cat."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Oops, sylladex is full. Gotta swap it with something.
<br />

<br />
Probably as good an excuse as any to break in a new FENESTRATED PLANE.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/26/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006404">"Roxy: Retrieve mutant kitten."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You swap the bottle with one dead cat in it for another. You often use this little guy to break in the planes, like an intrepid test pilot.
<br />

<br />
Not while it's in the bottle though. That would be ridiculous, since the bottles are sort of just inventory abstractions. You have to break the bottle first, before you can get serious about breaking some glass.<br><br><br>

Need to get this bullshit out of the way. You can't work like this with everything jammed down there in the corner. It's bad enough you're hammered.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/26/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006407">"Roxy: Break some glass."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 01/26/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006408">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your test pilot flew back out, which means the link between planes is working and stable. You can't even remember which one you linked this up to. You guess you'll find out the fast way.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/26/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006409">"Roxy: Jump in."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
From the perspective of anyone observing the two windows from the outside, transport looks instantaneous. But for the traveler, there's always this gap of void between them. In your experience, the more significant the journey between the planes is, the wider the gap. This one is small enough to be negligible though. Probably because it leads to somewhere else in your house. You've set a bunch of these up as little shortcuts to places around your house, as well as some places nearby like the lab. It's a convenient way to hop around, though isn't without some risk. You're still not sure what happens if one of the planes loses power while in transit, other than objects predictably getting sliced in half if they're straddling the plane when the plug is pulled. You haven't come up with a good way to observe the consequences from the inside yet, without using yourself as a giguinea pig. And you're in as much a hurry to try that as you are to look up the correct spelling of guinea pig, because seriously, fuck those particular pigs.<br><br><br>

 <b> 01/28/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006412">"Roxy: Land already."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
When you are quite through with that tomfoolery, you find yourself in your household's OBSERVATORY.
<br />

<br />
You keep it very cool in here and use it to store pumpkins you've appearified from around the world. Especially from Jake. That guy is just stinking rich with pumpkins on his dumb tropical island. It would never occur to you otherwise to be so grabby with pumpkins, but they just happen to be the most easily appearifiable vegetable on the planet for reasons that make no sense. And it's not like you can just stop swiping vegetables. You've got your own mysterious reasons.

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: its just that footage of my mom does that too</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like blacks out and stuff</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: mom was a notoirious scourge to the papayazzi</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: or i mean</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: the womom who im supposed to be genetically descended from</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: *womam</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: know what i mean?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i Understand what yoU're getting at, yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it is certainly possible that we may have common groUnd with oUr ancestors when it comes to oUr aspects, and the way oUr abilities reveal themselves to Us. i coUld not rUle this oUt.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt there is always more to examine.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: for instance, a hero of life and a hero of doom have aspects as different as can be.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt if their classes are different enoUgh as well, that is, one active and the other passive, remarkably there is a chance they coUld end Up with very similar abilities!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: player abilities may also manifest in ways in defiance with their aspects if they are heavily resistant to their trUe calling. or, if corrUpted in some way by an oUtside inflUence.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt it is rather clear to me yoU are one who embraces her aspect qUite heartily, even if yoU are not aware of it. ^u^</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: so....</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: deep down i am super psyched about nothigness</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: yeah souns about right</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: oh damn hey</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i almost forgot i had a really short but cool dream i fugured you might like this</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: oh yes, everyone is having important dreams as we near oUr mUtUal entries. this is lovely!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: please tell.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i saw someone i think was supposed to be my daughter</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: do you know if thats true</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: can yoU describe her?</span>
<br />

<span style="color: #929292">UU: she soUnds to me like the well known figUre of legend.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: or at least, well known to those who make the stUdy of sUch matters into their all consUming pastime. ~_u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i believe yoU saw the seer of light.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: lets say she is def that</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: xactly how much spoipage we talkin uu</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it woUld normally be my instinct to sUpply a vagUe response here...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt i think that yoUr heart has already told yoU the answer, and as sUch my secrecy woUld be pUrposeless.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: so, yes, that she was!</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: k im sorry</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: if yoU are really cUrioUs aboUt the events sUrroUnding yoUr daUghter's origin, yoU can always ask her in person when yoU meet her.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: so you mean</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: im going to meet her in the game</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: oh...</span>

<span style="color: #929292">UU: there is so mUch for me to keep track of, and it gets very difficUlt to remember what information to reveal at what time when yoU are flUstered.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ok so without pushin and flustratin you</span>
<br />

<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and the game will let me resurrect her from the dead and thats what im gonna do</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: the game provides a mechanism for the revival of the deceased, yes. it is called a kernelsprite, and yoU are free to gather remains of any dead party yoU choose, to revive that individUal in the form of a sprite. the sprite will then serve as a helpfUl spirit gUide on yoUr joUrney!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: yeah but you cleverly dodged the q</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: thats how u say it works but WILL i do that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i believe i was very forthright in my answer!</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: just like i descended from my mom through some sort of simimar bio process</span>
<br />

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ok well since youre so nice</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ill promoise not to use my wicked void powers re: basic common sense + skills of deduction to bust you up so bad</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i'd be ever so gratefUl. :u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: then w.o givin you the whole 3rd degree</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: what is safe to tell me?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like what does it mean to be a rogue of void</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: thats what i am rite</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes! i can tell yoU plenty aboUt that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: a rogUe is a passive class. yoU see, there are passive (+) and active (-) classes. some more strongly passive or active than others.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: the +/- distinction can mean many things, bUt coUld be qUite roUghly sUmmed Up in this way: active classes exploit their aspect to benefit themselves, while passive classes allow their aspect to benefit others.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt of coUrse there's plenty more to it, and that rUle is in no way absolUte. only a starting point for Understanding the dichotomy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: you mean kinda like</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: offensive vs defesive magic in an rpg</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: sUre!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: that's another fine way of looking at it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: classes always come in +/- pairs, with significant disparity between them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: while a rogUe is passive, a thief woUld be its far more active coUnterpart.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: the rogUe and thief classes tend to be assigned to females. not exclUsively, bUt commonly!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: other classes lean more toward male assignment, while others are exclUsively male, and jUst as many are exclUsively female. like my class. ^u^</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: that's a bit of a tangent thoUgh. to answer yoUr qUestion aboUt being a rogUe, i shoUld tell yoU both classes in +/- pairs tend to have very similar descriptions.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: in this case, a rogUe or a thief is &quot;one who steals.&quot; qUite simple, really!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt whether the class is + or - makes all the difference. it is a great indicator as to how a hero will make Use of the aspect.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: so basically</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: a thief is like the asshole class</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: the player who says step off shits mine suckas</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: whereas</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: a rogue</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: is bascially robin hood</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: if that reference to yoUr cUltUre provides a sUitable comparison, then absolUtely. :U</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: so im essantially the robin hood of void</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: im still not sure</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: wtf that actually means</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: Understandable.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i guess robin hods p cool tho</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: thiefin up loot from peeps who got too much</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: then all sugardaddyin it out 2 the needy like a boss</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: just dont have a clue how that works with void</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes, it is one of the more conceptUally nebUloUs pairings, i agree.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and i can't say i know a smashing good deal aboUt the natUre of the void player's path, since the aspect is by definition inscrUtable to those it does not choose.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt i can at least tell yoU this.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: if yoU are ever to enjoy fUll ascension as a rogUe of void, yoU will be able to do some completely astonishing things!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like what</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: oh no, yoU will not pry this oUt of me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: not to preserve caUsality, bUt to keep the sUrprise in store for yoU.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it woUld not be honoUrable of me to spoil the discovery, shoUld yoU be fortUnate enoUgh to realize yoUr potential.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: well</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: about that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i feel sorta stupid about this but</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ive been giving all my friends this whole dramagic spiel about not wanting to even play this thing</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and i might of fucked stuff up already</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: is that so?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: its so</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and i guess i still havnt decide what to do</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: there are props and cons 2 both things</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: woUld yoU mind listing them?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ok either i dont play</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and i get this kinda passive aggressive revange at the witch for killing my mom</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and thereafter keep staying here and being lonely</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: or</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i do play and the spoips r as follows...</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: that's another statement that doesn't make a good deal of sense to me, bUt if it is important to yoU, then godspeed!</span>

<br />
You are now Dirk. What the hell was going on here again? That's right. You were lodged in the bulbous cleft of paradox space's huge foam ass, and we were hoping to trouble you for a bit of context. Something to set our watches to, if you'd be so kind. Perhaps your successive actions will oblige us?
<br />

<br />
Ha ha, j/k young bro, we know you don't give a shit. Go ahead and do whatever feels right.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/30/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006418">"Dirk: Go get your sword."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You retrieve your UNBREAKABLE KATANA. A real hard sword for a real hard dude. It was said to be forged by an ancient Otaku Master over the heat of a roaring manga fire. It was cooled in an enchanted spring where virgin horses nicker and bathe, and was said could be used only by one whose pointy anime shades were deemed sweet enough, and whose hair existed in a perpetually sculpted state of looking completely fucking awesome. All of those things were said by you.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/30/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006419">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You like to juggle around a few different allocations in your portfolio besides bladekind, mostly ironically. You take a certain amount of pride in being able to beat practically anyone's ass down with a puppet, a martial discipline for which there is a startling variety of techniques.
<br />

<br />
Fancysantakind is a straightup shits and giggles specibus, though. Nobody is quite sure how to extract damage from a foe using an extremely elaborate santa figurine. But if anyone can figure it out, it is probably you.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/31/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006420">"Dirk: Give Lil Cal a nervous fist bump."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Nervous? That's absurd.

<br />
There's no reason to be nervous around Cal. Lil Cal is the shit.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/31/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006421">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
He's been around as long as you can remember. You were practically raised by that puppet. He was a much better guardian to you than that Hollywood superstar BRO of yours ever was. He is such a good listener. You share with him all your most private thoughts and hopes and dreams, and sometimes you snuggle up with him for a nice nap.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, the bottom line is, puppets are awesome. 
<br />

<br />
And that's really all there is to say on the matter.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/31/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006422">"Dirk: Admire fancy santa."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Look at this pompous little asshole. What a godawful piece of shit this thing is.
<br />

<br />
You aren't even sure why you keep these things around. The miasma of tackiness that surrounds them is almost enough to outstrip their irony value.
<br />

<br />
Almost.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/31/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006423">"Dirk: Greet robotic friend."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You say yo what up to this dude over here, and exchange a unique series of hand shakes and fist bumps.
<br />

<br />
His name is SQUAREWAVE. You built him to have rap-offs with now and then. He's an enthusiastic rapper, and gives it his all whenever you duel, but he's pretty easy to destroy. You've never lost a match against him.
<br />

<br />
You have only built one other rapbot besides him. His name is SAWTOOTH. You designed him to be unbeatable in a rap-off, and he is. You have never won a match against him. You hope to one day, but you're not gonna hold your breath. His flow is just that insane.
<br />

<br />
You keep one of his spare heads over there on your desk, but otherwise you don't see much of him. It's been months since your last encounter. He presumably spends his time traveling the world, annihilating any rapper foolish enough to challenge him.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/31/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006424">"Dirk: Examine wardrobe."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You tell Squarewave to scoot out of the way so you can get a load of your sweet fashions. Aw, looks like he really wanted to rap with you! Sorry guy, maybe another time.
<br />

<br />
This is your WARDROBIFIER. It automagically rotates your fashions whenever you feel like.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/31/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006425">"Dirk: Change shirt."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You bust out a tank top, which is THE go-to solution for hard dudes who want to show off their guns. It is a very STRONG look, you think.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/31/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006426">"Dirk: What the hell is that on your arm..."</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 01/31/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006427">"Dirk: Examine little posters."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
R.I.P. Stiller. 
<br />

<br />
Poor bastard. Had to go and get all tangled up with your brother's crazy, complicated life.
<br />

<br />
As for the other one...
<br />

<br />
You are a studious popculture scholar of all eras. A sharp critic of that reflection in the mirror we hold up to our society. You seek truth in the vivid mosaic made of our most shameless obsessions.
<br />

<br />
Your interest in these cartoon ponies is strictly academic, ok? No, seriously.
<br />

<br />
...
<br />

<br />
What?
<br />

<br />
......
<br />

<br />
OK FINE, YOU LOVE THIS ONE PARTICULAR LITTLE RAINBOW HORSE UNIRONICALLY, IS THAT SUCH A CRIME.

She is so spunky. &lt;3<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/31/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006428">"Dirk: Examine puppet/hat pile."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The pile at the foot of your bed consists of hats, a few stray robo-parts, and SMUPPETS. Smuppets are a lovable sort of plush of your own design. You love everything about puppets. You're always thinking about the craft of their production, their operation, cool new designs and such. If the cosmos didn't have more important plans for you, and if the world weren't so fucked up, you'd make a run at fame and fortune with your own puppet enterprises, just like your BRO did with all his weird shit.
<br />

<br />
You also love to keep a bunch of HATS around, even though you never wear them. You love HATS. Because all bros love HATS, and that's what you are. A bro.
<br />

<br />
You'd consider wearing one now and then, but they don't really fit the dimensions of your head yet. And anyway, it would be criminal to mess up your perfect hair. Instead, you do the next best thing, which is wearing a picture of one on your shirt. And by the next best thing, you're pretty sure you mean the vastly superior thing.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/31/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006429">"Dirk: Check out big tv."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
When you're not using the screen for other purposes, you have it set to rotate through some images by default, like a digital picture frame.
<br />

<br />
The image flips from a totally bitchin' horse puppet sorta thing, to a portrait of everyone's favorite comedy duo, Stiller and Wilson.
<br />

<br />
Your BRO made so many of these movies, it's hard to keep track of them. The series drifted almost imperceptibly from surrealist slapstick and inexplicable boxoffice dynamite, to veiled, near-subliminal protest pieces designed to expose the corporate tyranny slowly taking control of the world. The statement did not go unnoticed by the Baroness, and soon the conflict between your brother's media empire and Crockercorp was a matter of public spectacle. Though the press has generally played up the rivalry as an extremely high stakes display of performance art. And knowing your bro, there is surely at least some truth to this.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/31/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006430">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Donald Glover won an academy award for his transcendental performance as Geromy. After his acceptance speech, there was not a single dry eye in the house. His heroic effort on the silver screen was heralded by critics everywhere as a defining moment in cinematic history. 
<br />

<br />
Alas, the Batterwitch did not look upon his achievement as kindly.
<br />

<br />
She had him assassinated.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/31/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006431">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And that one is...
<br />

<br />
Never mind what that one is. You can't stand around all day looking at movie stills and swole bunny men. There's still some other shit in your room to investigate.
<br />

<br />
You switch back to your regular shirt. You weren't feeling the wifebeater. The tee shirt says &quot;I still got work to do&quot;, while the other one says, &quot;which trailer's the party at?&quot; And Striders don't party til it's good and fuckin' time to party.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/31/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006432">"Dirk: Examine red microwave."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It isn't a microwave. It's your SENDIFICATOR!
<br />

<br />
Pretty much the only Crockertech you can bring yourself to use. It's just too handy not to.
<br />

<br />
You just type the coordinates, pop in the thing you want to sendificate, and hit the button. It'll sendificate that thing in a jiffy, assuming it's temporally allowed, and within size restrictions.
<br />

<br />
Obviously you can only send what you can fit inside there. You had to send Jake your brobot piece by piece, barely managing to squeeze that shiny melon head in there. He then dutifully assembled the robot himself. Poor fool, so jovially complicit in his own merciless jungle predation. It's all for the best, though. When you're through with English, he will be a ruthless killing machine. Mark your words.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/01/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006433">"Dirk: Captchalogue Geromy plush."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You snap up the GEROMY PLUSH in your TECH-HOP MODUS. This modus is often employed in rap battles, but is a bit more elegant and sophisticated than what most hashrap artists traditionally employ, like the more arbitrarily numeric HASH MAPS and HASH TABLES.
<br />

<br />
The cards are arranged in SHADE COLUMNS and GROOVE ROWS. Everything in the same column has to rhyme. Everything in the same row has to have some thematic similarity. Organizing everything gets complicated, and weaponizing your inventory through rap lyrics takes some serious skill.
<br />

<br />
For instance, the 3rd GROOVE ROW got kind of railroaded into becoming an orange soda row, so you've just been rolling with it recently. The 4th row is pegged for stuff associated with cool bros. The 2nd row is all about dolls, puppets, and stuff like that. The GEROMY PLUSH is clearly suitable for that row, and rhymes with CRUSH, so that works out.
<br />

<br />
Then you have some other perfectly dope rhymes, like SANTA and FANTA, FAYGO and GAME BRO, DEW and SHOE. There's also SMUPPET and ORANGETTE, which frankly you think is pretty weak, but hey the modus allows it so whatever. Then there are times where you have to be creative with naming stuff to get it to fit. Like calling a skateboard a FOUR WHEEL DEVICE to get it to rhyme with SLICE. It's just another facet to the craft.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/01/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006434">"Dirk: Captchalogue Sweet Bro plush."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Might as well complete the plush collection. You grab the SWEET BRO off your bed. It intersects quite conveniently with the PLUSH GROOVE and the FAYGO SHADE. Nice one.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/01/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006435">"Dirk: Captchalogue Hella Jeff plush."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Last but not least...
<br />

<br />
There is nothing here that rhymes with Hella Jeff. It really isn't worth jumping through a lot of linguistic hoops to pick this thing up right now, so you just forget it. You have to pick your battles, you know?<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/01/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006436">"Dirk: Take sord....."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You pick up the mighty SORD.....
<br />

<br />
The easiest thing to do here is ditch the SLICE, stick the SORD..... in the weapons row, and rhyme it with BOARD.
<br />

<br />
Your bro had a lot of junk like this manufactured over the years. He patented the technology for producing THREE DIMENSIONAL JPEG ARTIFACTS, to make products shittier than was ever previously imaginable. He made a killing off them. Not because anyone bought this garbage. But because they were so cheap to manufacture, their cost was actually NEGATIVE, therefore miraculously netting him profit for every unit produced. He made so much money this way, he had enough to finance manned space missions to haul all of the hideous unwanted jpeg shit off the Earth, and launch it into the sun. But years thereafter, every now and then someone would report a stray shitty skateboard slowly drifting back into Earth's atmosphere. People would pray they would burn up on reentry. But they never would.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/02/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006437">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Aw, look. Squarewave saw you messing around with your sylladex and thought you were preparing for a rap battle. He is kind of like an eager pet dog, and you made the mistake of picking up his leash, and now he thinks he's going for a walk. You hate to break his heart, but you just don't have time. Your concentration is divided enough as it is.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/02/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006438">"Dirk: Be dream self."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Among the many ways you tend to multitask is by maintaining an ever-alert dream self. There's a lot to keep an eye on when it comes to the cloak and dagger politics of Derse, especially these days. Can't let your guard down for a second.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/02/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006439">"Dirk: Examine sleazy Dersite rag."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It's the latest issue of THE ENQUIRING CARAPACIAN, touting the recent assassination of Prospit's Maid of Life. Quite the triumph for the dark kingdom, and the press has predictably sensationalized the event to please the royalty and whip its readership into a nationalistic lather. In spite of all the ridiculous hyperbole and baseless slander found in the tabloids, one thing is clear. This development means nothing but trouble. If Noir has been empowered to take measures like this, you may have to accelerate your plans.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006440">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

While you were making short work of Squarewave, you once again made the mistake of letting your other self's guard down. 
<br />

<br />
You are accosted by a Dersite agent with a serious AXE TO GRIND. These guys aren't supposed to know you're awake. Looks like your cover's blown unless you act fast.<br><br><br>

<br />
Poor HEGEMONIC BRUTE. His time in the spotlight has been cut tragically short. You almost feel sorry for the guy.
<br />

<br />
But now you have a problem. You spend the next ten minutes thinking about it while you stand on his head and stare at the blood on your hands, as the often utilized stock graphic in the bottom corner of the image would indicate.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/04/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006446">"Dirk: Check on Roxy."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Since the Archagent is clearly leading the assassination efforts personally on Prospit, this means the DRACONIAN DIGNITARY is most likely focused on the Derse dreamers. He almost certainly ordered the Brute to off you in your sleep. You can only hope the Dignitary or one of his assassins hasn't already gotten to her.<br><br><br>

 <b> 02/06/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006449">"Dirk: Be waking self again."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This is kind of a redundant thing to do since you are always consciously both your waking and dream self at the same time, but you'll let it slide. 
<br />

<br />
You should probably stop dwelling on your Derse problems and try to get this show on the road.<br><br><br>

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: &lt;3</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Now maybe we should direct our focus on a matter which has nothing at all to do with what does or doesn't qualify as &quot;a thing&quot;, or what our fantasy alt-universe offspring would be like, or anything like that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Such as this game, and whether you're in the best condition to be piloting Jane's connection.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Maybe you could use another nap?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: my condidions just fine</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: we both know her plans need us to</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I know that. But I thought we settled this.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: its still so frustrating</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: tellin jane about the dangers</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and even if shes being polite i just know she thinks im fulla crap</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: about EVREYTHING</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: We settled this too. She'll believe everything eventually.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Why bother working so hard to convince her?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: well i dont even do that for the most part</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: but it gets tiring and saddening</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: knowing that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: even when were not activly talkin bout it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: that my best friend cant bring herself to believe some really basic things about my life</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like the shitty things the baroness has done to us</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: or about our upbringin</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: do u know how misrable it is for your bff to doubt you</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: when you tell her your mom is dead</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I guess.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It just registers for me as a reaction which isn't completely unreasonable from her perspective.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She is inundated with media coverage of those whom we've claimed as our parental figures.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That they are not presently alive nor ever played that role for us as she understands it is just an extension of a much more elaborate and far reaching explanation, which is much harder for anyone to digest in its entirety.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well, anyone who isn't Jake, I mean.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Still say you should cut her some slack.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i know</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And need I remind you,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That the potential this game provides for their resurrection is what motivated you to investigate it in the first place?</span><br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok, here's the thing with the AR, since you still don't seem to get it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: He's very similar to me in thought process and behavior, yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But those patterns were imported from a thirteen year old version of my psyche, and then sealed into the program as starting parameters.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: In the years since, we've both evolved somewhat. I, as humans tend to, and he, in whatever way is natural for a frequently running, self-aware application.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So if there are differences between us, they're first reflected by what I feel is a maturity gap, and then further by several years of minor behavioral divergences.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: omg...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: hes 13yo dirk</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: why did than not occur to me that is so cute</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes, I was aware.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Dude, do you think you could sit this one out for a while? This conversation practically doesn't even concern you at this point.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It seems there is some gnarly crooked number that represents the percentage of probability you just said this doesn't concern me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Even though it's patently obvious that half the conversation, like, way totally concerns me.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I was thinking about what to do.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Strategizing. Factoring contingencies. You know how it is.</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Yes, the number. The big circle number, genius.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I knew you meant the fucking number, my question was a joke.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I know your question was a joke, my response was a joke.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Like, calculated it so much, I got to the end.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Bullshit.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You wish it was bullshit. The last number is 4. Read it and fucking weep.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's not 4 you jackass, it's fucking nothing. There is no end.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Said the smug organic matter with a lifespan.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Look, I know you're just fucking with me because for some reason I decided to program my own personal troll three years ago, but this shit was proven.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Actually demonstrated with unassailable mathematics, like a long ass time ago.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Well, I just assailed it. It wasn't even that hard.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Like I just kept hacking those digits so furiously with my sick 'rithms, the whole goddamn number just cried uncle.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I kind of wore it out, and it just gave up. Sort of like I overloaded the system.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You know like in the old movie when Ferris Bueller got the nuclear computer to play tic-tac-toe against itself so hard, it blew up?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: This is laughable. It's a totally elementary thing. I'm pretty sure an ancient Greek guy settled shit about irrational numbers. It was practically when math was invented.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Sure, it was settled, and then some roboshades came along and owned that fucker posthumously.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I also figured out all the prime numbers too.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, not having this conversation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Did it while we were talking just now. Got to the end.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: And you know what? The last one isn't even that big. Kinda dissapointed, to be honest.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What is even a prime number?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Are they the, like... really, really choice ones? The sweetest numbers?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You lost me, supercomputer.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: This is what I'm saying. I put your ability to keep plates spinnin' on sticks to insane amounts of shame.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I don't even sleep.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Neither do I.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I know that, that was the fucking joke.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Holy shit, turns out joking was the basis for my response too.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Aren't these ironic &quot;you don't get the joke&quot; conversations we have always just so awesome? &lt;- A joke.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Ha ha, nice one.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Anyway, all I'm saying is you can leave some of the heavy lifting to me now and then.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'll keep that in mind.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: In the meantime, I have to contact Jane and warn her Roxy might try to pull that pointless stunt.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So, thanks for snapping me out of my daydream so I could do that, I guess?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Looks like you're pulling your weight already.</span>
<br />

I, a street-smart, fast-talking application with a fuckzillion IQ trapped in a pair of triangular sunglasses that literally only the Japanese could consider to embody the Platonic ideal of &quot;cool,&quot; and she, an oft-inebriated lonely hacker teen who just wants a boyfriend. I ran the numbers on this, trust me. It's a match made in goddamn crackpair heaven.</span>

<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Who's right?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Jane, I'm going to leave you with the responder for a little while.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Maybe he can help you get started. Think you can handle that, dude?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I'm all about being able to handle that, you don't even know.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I will perform an acrobatic pirouette on to the handle, wherein the handle literally represents my ability to handle that thing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok, got it. You and the handle are tight.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: We don't need a whole thing about this.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Once I stick the landing on the handle like a champ, I am going to get down on one knee, pull out a ring, and propose to it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: The handle I mean.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Implying we will be married.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: :B</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok, long story short, you and the handle fuck gratuitously. Nuff said.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Try not to say I never gave you any responsibilities, or never took you seriously as a viable conscious being with free will.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Also, please try not to make me regret this.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You have nothing to worry about. Go talk to the alien.</span>

<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i see yoU're aboUt ready to begin. how splendid for yoU. ^u^</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i'm at dangeroUs risk of jealoUsy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Why?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: oh, it's jUst i'm rUnning a bit behind schedUle. i wanted to coordinate with yoUr groUp in something approximating real time, and that is starting to look less likely.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: my client player continUes to be a soUrce of frUstration. u_u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i'd thoUght we had everything settled, bUt it's always something with him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i even told him in my last message it woUld sUit me fine if he wanted to be the server player instead. i jUst want to begin!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt i have not heard back from him... &gt;:u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That's probably the way it always is. I've run into plenty of problems here already, and I've had to improvise heavily.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ain't nothing about our situation to envy yet.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt at least i know how certain things go when it comes to yoUr story.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i don't qUite have that lUxUry with mine! it is nerve wracking sometimes, especially when i mUst coUnt on him to be responsible.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well, your bro definitely has got some problems. Not gonna lie.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: this is trUe.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: thoUgh i'm sUre i've said, he isn't qUite my brother. we are related, yes, bUt not in the way hUman brothers and sisters are. </span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: we are genetically similar, bUt in many ways qUite different. in fact, oUr blood coloUr is not even the same!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt i have referred to him as a brother at times becaUse it is close enoUgh to being trUe, mUch as yoU refer to the one yoU regard as yoUr ancestor in the same way.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Just give him some time. He'll probably come around.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You would never even have woken up on Prospit if you weren't going to launch the session, right?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I mean, there wouldn't even be a session for a Prospit to exist inside if you weren't about to instantiate it in the first place. Unless I'm just totally not getting how this works.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: no, i think yoU're probably right.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: while i await his response, perhaps i will take a nap, and see if the cloUds may offer any gUidance.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: thoUgh lately i have been seeing many more black cloUds cropping Up in skaia than UsUal. it is a most Unwelcome trend. u_u;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You're lucky to have any clouds.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Only thing I have to look up at is infinite monsters.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: good point! :U</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i am so pleased to be a prospit dreamer. i'm sUre my brother finds his netherworldly affiliation similarly pleasing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Speaking of which,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I have a problem, and I could use your advice.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: is that so?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I killed an agent who snuck into my room to assassinate me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'm not sure what to do about it now. I guess I could just ditch the corpse.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But it's still only a matter of time before my cover is blown.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes, that is a pickle.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I honestly can't think of a way around this. Getting found out, I mean.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Roxy has it easy. All floating off into space, completely oblivious to any danger.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I don't know why it had to be this way for me. Juggling these two waking selves at once.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I guess I'm used to it, but it still makes for a pretty intense existence.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Do you even know what the deal with that is? Like is there any precedent in your readings?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i don't know aboUt precedent, bUt it makes plenty of sense to me as the type of path one might expect for a hero of heart.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: a path rUled by the heart aspect can be a joUrney of splintered self.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: that is, the player's being may exhibit the same kind of fragmentation which certain classes coUld caUse in others.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i think this is what has triggered yoUr dUal-awareness between waking and dream selves, thoUgh it woUld not sUrprise me if the symptoms manifested in even more ways than this.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So, that's what a Prince of Heart does?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Just has like, multiple waking consciousness disorder, or something?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Sounds kind of stupid.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: no!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: like i said, these can be traits of sUch a hero, bUt is not necessarily always the case, nor is it the defining property of the aspect.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: to Understand the heart aspect better, yoU might Use it interchangeably with the word soUl.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: the hero Uses the methods endowed by class to inflUence in some way the soUl, or essence of being, of oneself or of others.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Then I'm basically the Prince of Soul.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That sounds kind of maybe a little cooler. Sort of.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Then what am I supposed to be able to do as a Prince? Like, rule over souls in a pompous, regal manner?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: no!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: again, sUrface meaning of classes and aspects can be deceptive.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: a prince is a destroyer class.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it is very far on the active side of the scale. its more passive coUnterpart woUld be the bard class. both of these are exclUsively designated for male players.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: to Understand a hero's capabilities, it always helps to search for the right way to parse the class/aspect pair into a more explicit statement.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: for instance, being active, a prince coUld be viewed as &quot;one who destroys x, or caUses destrUction throUgh x,&quot; if x is the aspect.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: while the more passive bard coUld be seen as &quot;one who allows x to be destroyed, or invites destrUction throUgh x,&quot; as if by the will of the aspect.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'm obviously no expert, but that sounds like a pretty odd thing for a Bard to do.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: maybe! it's a qUirky class.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: somewhat like a wildcard role for a hero. very Unpredictable.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: they are typically known for their spontaneoUs and dramatic story-altering inflUence on the fate of a party.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: some of the more remarkable tales involve sUch parties, where the bard is single handedly responsible for their spectacUlar downfall or improbable victory. or both!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: in trUth, yoU are probably fortUnate yoUr groUp doesn't have one. :u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I think we have enough unpredictability as it is.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So if I'm following, my title nearly parses as,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Destroyer of Souls.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: indeed.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well, that's a little more badass sounding I guess.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But I'm not sure I'll ever feel a major need to destroy a soul, unless I become a cartoonishly villainous sorcerer some day.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i woUldn't be hasty in rUling it oUt.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: that is, finding the need to Use the ability, not sUccUmbing to any sort of villainy. u~u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: we tend to have these roles for a reason, and that reason UsUally finds Us. especially if we are to achieve god tier ascension.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok. Do I do that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: no dirk!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i mean, no, i will not tell yoU!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Give me a fuckin' break.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Why don't you just tell me? Who cares about spoilers. What's gonna happen is gonna happen.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: that very well may be, bUt it will dreadfUlly complicate both of oUr lives if what is to come resUlts from self-fUlfillment alone!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: a great deal of instrUctional material is very clear on this.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: besides, yoU make it soUnd as thoUgh i know everything, which i most certainly do NOT. upu</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: (pardon the sideways tongUe.)</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Wait. Don't you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I thought you did.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i have read mUch aboUt yoUr story in texts and have pieced together the overarching, exceedingly complicated saga as best as i coUld. i have as mUch aUthority over these events as a historian, and am at the mercy of my soUrces.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i also am able to access mUch of yoUr adventUre throUgh this terminal, bUt there is a limitation to this too, which i may as well admit now to get yoU off of my back!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i can view all events involving yoU and yoUr coplayers on earth, for yoUr entire lives, Until yoU enter the game.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i can also view some events after yoUr session begins, bUt not for very long, thanks to yoUr tipsy friend.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Oh man. What the hell does she do?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: she blacks oUt yoUr entire session!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i'm sUre this is not deliberate on her part, bUt thereafter i can see nothing at all.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Huh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt i have never considered this to the detriment of either party. i still wish for Us to collaborate, and to help each other oUt.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: beyond a certain point, we simply mUst commUnicate in the dark.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: so there are many things aboUt yoUr fUtUre i do not know, at least not first hand.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt as yoU have probably ventUred, i am qUite an enthUsiastic admirer of yoUr groUp of heroes and yoUr incredible story. ^u^</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: thoUgh i can't see what happens mUch later, i can certainly specUlate. and i very often do. i gUess it woUld not hUrt to share some of my specUlation with yoU.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: in fact, now that i consider it, that coUld be the most fUn thing of all!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Speculation?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes. theories! examining all the clUes and hazarding oUr gUesses.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: what does it all mean? everything aboUt yoUr vast epic points to a central mystery which i have not been able to solve yet.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yoU might even call it the Ultimate riddle, if that were not already codified as &quot;a thing&quot; in scriptUre.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i have so very many theories, i woUldn't even know where to begin.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You're kind of obsessed with us then.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i woUldn't go that far! oh my, i'm probably coming off as an absolUte nUtter now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, not really. I just want to understand.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So can I ask,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Just to get a better sense of the nature of your &quot;admiration,&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: When you engage in the aforementioned speculation, is it strictly on a factual basis?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: hm? :u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Or do you start to...</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: UUUUUUm...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What I'm asking is, have you ever written stories about us?</span>

<br />
You never leave your room through the actual egress. Your bro blocked the door ages ago with this totally pimp stone bust. You give CAPTAIN SNOOP a little nod of approval every time you walk by to go to the bathroom. You like to think he nods back in a way that is so smooth and so subtle, he literally doesn't move at all.
<br />

<br />
The thing is too heavy to move out of the way, and in any case you don't really want to. You just use a different exit to your room.<br><br><br>

<br />
After an insane, full blown whirlwind of free will up in here, you are ready to get off this rollercoaster ride of absolute empowerment. You are feeling downright dizzy from the absurd amounts of decisive autovolition heaped upon you, and you are more than ready to proceed linearly for a while.
<br />

<br />
You are now Jane. A robot shaped like a bunny has just handed you the reins to a computer shaped like a man. What will you do?<br><br><br>

<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Hes been my best friend forever and ive always liked him a lot as a bro.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But of course that was before i started to realize he was probably serious about those feelings for me regardless.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Heheh come to think of it maybe that was unwittingly poor form on my part kind of leading him on or something?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Whoops!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But then...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Later i started thinking.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Maybe i was being kind of unfair to him in the first place?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I mean by saying we would be a good match only if he was a girl.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Like is that last condition there really all THAT important?</span>

<br />
He says the deceased child count is still sitting at zero over here. You say WHAT? He says that's not all. You wait for him to spill the beans.
<br />

<br />
He says one of the brats staged a little rebellion on the moon. Stuck the Brute's head on a pike for all to see. Real black eye for the kingdom and the Condesce. Press is going nuts with it. Wait. The Brute's dead, you say? He says yes. Dammit. He was one of your best agents. You never really cared for the guy but you admired his brutality. We all did sir, he says. This is getting personal you say. What's the status on these little shits. Where are they now?
<br />

<br />
He says the Prince flew the coop. And the girl's gone... You say gone what. Rogue? After a little while he says AWOL. The guy doesn't really take a shining to puns and you can't say you blame him.

<br />
Why did you have to clone so many cats? Why did they all have to breed so much?
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Why do they all have to be so friendly???</span><br><br><br>
 <b> 02/24/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006503">"Roxy: Proceed to transmaterializer."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You trudge through the fluffy morass in the direction of the mysterious device known as the TRANSMATERIALIZER.
<br />

<br />
Need to send this dead cat back to mom and get this show on the road.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/24/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006504">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
More noises echoing in the distance. Some of the meowcats get nervous and poof up their tails.
<br />

<br />
It's pretty clear you aren't alone in here. Better make this quick.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/25/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006505">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You never understood what the point of this thing was. It's old and damaged. Whatever is supposed to show up on the screens is blacked out, either due to the damage, or due to this voidey blackout bullshit that seems to follow you wherever you go.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/25/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006506">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Here's the lab's funky appearifier which you used to clone all these cats. You use your other appearifier to make paradox slime from cats, gather and mix the slime in this machine, and crank out the mutant kitties. You can't use the cloning device's native appearifier to make cats, because the target is locked on to your mom. Most of the time the screen is blacked out, so you haven't been able to investigate her past carefully, much to your regret. Or her tragic death, for that matter. Right now the target is locked on to a time from her childhood.
<br />

<br />
It's a good thing you stopped by. It's reminding you to collect a DNA sample for later, so you can jumpstart this tri generational lolonde family reonion that's apparently supposed to happen.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/25/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006507">"Roxy: Appearify."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/25/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006508">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Looks like, as expected, trying to appearify your mother as a kid from the past would have created a paradox, so her paradox slime is the result. But QUITE unexpectedly, bringing her scarf along for the ride seems to have created no conflict, and you swiped it right off her neck! Young mom probably has no idea what the hell just happened to her scarf. This is so exciting!
<br />

<br />
You are SO gonna wear that thing, you don't care HOW mom-gooey it is.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/25/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006509">"Roxy: Collect sample."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You stow the kidmomgoo in one of your captchalogue bottles.
<br />

<br />
Wait...
<br />

<br />
That was kind of a weird implementation of your modus. You're not even sure what happened there. Oh well, whatever. You guess you can go just... sort of... 
<br />

<br />
Pick it up?<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/25/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006510">"Roxy: Go just sort of pick it up."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You go just sort of pick it up and that works fine. Now about that totes baller scarf.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/25/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006511">"Roxy: Wear the scarf. Be the Rider."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You can't be the rider because in this universe the pony is too small for some reason. Not that being the rider ever really made much sense in the first place. Anyway, the scarf looks great, and you made a great decision.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/25/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006512">"Roxy: Get to that transmaterializer."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This is probably the most perplexing device in the lab to you. It seems to be a sort of appearifier/sendificator hybrid. But it uses a massive amount of power, far more than the simpler appearifier uses. Sending Frigglish home should nearly deplete its entire fuel gauge. You have no idea what could possibly account for the extra power consumption. There are many other puzzling things about it. You don't know what the deal is with that frog up there. Or the strange cracked disc symbol, or the arrow which is locked firmly on the B1 side. It's all completely meaningless to you. The only things that make sense are the fuel gauge, the two big buttons, and the coordinate panels indicating where and when to target.
<br />

<br />
But it looks like the panels have been damaged somehow since the last time you looked at it. If you changed them, there'd be no telling what you would change them to, so you might as well not bother and leave them on their previous setting. Which was pretty much your plan anyway.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/25/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006513">"Roxy: Deploy Frigglish."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You bust open a bottle of dead cat on the pad and get a little teary eyed as you say one last goodbye.
<br />

<br />
Oh, hello, GCat. Come to pay your respects, huh?<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/25/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006514">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The GCat unceremoniously washes a paw with his omnipotent green tongue. Nothing to say there buddy? No remorse at all?
<br />

<br />
This is all his fault of course. Even though he probably didn't mean to get him killed. At least you <span style="font-style: italic">think</span> he didn't.
<br />

<br />
D'aw who are you kidding. You can't stay mad at cats.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/25/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006515">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Others gather around to bid farewell to their common ancestor. This is probably the closest he will ever come to receiving a proper funeral.<br><br><br>
 <b> 02/25/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006516">"Roxy: Send him home."</a></b><br><br>

<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: and most importantly</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: how is everything going to go wrong this time</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: From what I understand, everything already has gone wrong before the game even started, in many different ways than ours did.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: There are indications of thicker political intrigue. Assassination attempts. And a usurpation of the throne more insidious than what we dealt with.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: But those examples still don't illustrate the fundamental fault with their session.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Ours had a similar fault. It was a null session.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Literature on the subject says null sessions are actually very common.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: It is any session resulting in failure, and as such, designed to result in failure from the start, due to Skaia's comprehensive &quot;knowledge&quot; of its own fate, and that of all it illumines.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Biologically speaking, it's to be expected that null sessions far outnumber the successful ones. When it comes to reproductive systems, overwhelming redundancy is commonplace.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: A universe has a reproductive system that spreads many seeds, as it were, most of which never come to fruition. So we shouldn't feel too bad about our results, really. It was quite par for the course.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: But then, it would also seem that exceedingly few null sessions result in the birth of a massive green star fueled by two dead universes. For what it's worth.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: ok but i thought the whole point of this</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Well, yes. There's more to it though.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: The new session is essentially our session, rebooted with different parameters which also affected the original conditions of our universe.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: And strangely, it seems the new one is a null session as well, but within a much less common subset of all null sessions.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: This one is referred to as a void session.</span><br><br><br>

<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: ok</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: which is what</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: It's very simply a session in which nothing is prototyped before entry, at all.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Hence, by Skaia's preemptive all-knowing and its influence on the rest of the incipisphere, there are not even any towers on Prospit or Derse built to receive the split kernels.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: See?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: weird</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: why would these alt universe players fuck up in such an obvious and stupid way</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: I don't know what specifically led to the failure to prototype anything.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: But it doesn't really matter. As I said, the session was designed this way before they began playing. Any efforts to prototype may have been in vain regardless. Possibly subject to sabotage.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: didnt you say at some point that not prototyping anything would be really bad</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: It's just another way to create an infertile session. Though by a less catastrophic and bloody route we took to achieve the same result.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: By contrast, it leads to a rather harmless, uneventful session. Underlings remain unaugmented, and so does the royalty.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: And while this may sound advantageous to the players, it's a curse in disguise. The lack of prototypings which keeps adversaries unevolved has the same influence on the battlefield.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Without successive prototypings, the battlefield will never reach its final form, which must be fertilized to grow a new universe.</span><br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Instead, it remains in its most basic form, stuck in eternal stalemate.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: There is nothing players in a void session can do to change this. They are resigned to live out the rest of their days in a dead end session.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: The new session is a blank slate, without a ridiculously short time limit for victory like ours had.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: There will be no time limit at all, in fact.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Once we arrive, ostensibly that is when the nature of the session will change.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: It won't be classifiable as either a null or void session anymore. It will be something which, as far as I can tell, is unique.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: The fully matured battlefield from our session can be used to make the new one viable. The path to success will be made possible by a combination of efforts and assets from both iterations.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Usually scratched sessions are absolute resets, and involve no direct influence from the first attempt at all. I can't find any precedent for our situation.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: When I said there would be no time limit in this session, I was talking about something more specific.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: There will be no reckoning.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: oh</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: why not</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: It's a logical consequence of any void session.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: The battlefield never evolves, and therefore the more extensive war between Prospit and Derse never takes shape.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: It is only when the Prospitian king falls in battle that the reckoning can be initiated by the forces of Derse.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: The meteors then rush to destroy the battlefield, while Skaia redirects them through defense portals for as long as it can.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Thus, if there is no war, there is no reckoning, no meteors, and no imminent threat of failure.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: This is of course good news for Earth as well. During the reckoning, Skaia redirects all incoming meteors to the only place it can. Earth.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: So it turns out that players who initiate a void session are not actually condemning their home planet to an apocalyptic wasteland after they leave.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Just the vast majority of the destructive onslaught never showed up.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: But delivering the temple to the site of the forge is still integral to jumpstarting the session.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: That meteor however could have been propelled through a portal by any means, not just via the reckoning.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: To understand what happened, it really helps to understand exactly what a scratch is.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: When John severely damaged the Beat Mesa on your planet, and sent it off to Skaia to release its temporal energy there, you could view it as a kind of &quot;request.&quot;</span>

<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: We were asking Skaia to change everything at a fundamental level, and we gave it the energy to do so.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: But Skaia is a very passive entity. It only &quot;knows&quot; and &quot;sees,&quot; but it never quite &quot;acts.&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: When it is asked to change everything, there is only so much it has control over.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: In fact, it has control over exactly one thing. The defense portals.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: It can decide to send important meteors to different points in time than originally planned, thus creating alternate realities.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Offshoots of promise, rather than futility.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: And it turns out the most important meteors of all tend to be the ones delivering the young players to their planet.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: So all it has to do to change everything is tweak their destination times a bit.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: All internally-prompted changes in the post-scratch universe are decided entirely by this modest adjustment to the parameters.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: It's a very simple concept, actually.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Yet the consequences are dramatic. It results in not only a hard reset for the session, but a partial reset for the universe too, due to the many causal entanglements between a session and its originating universe.</span>

<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i dont want ghosts to be afraid of him</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i want to make friends with some ghosts if at all possible</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it is not possible, ghosts are known to be cruel and mischievous.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: they will not want to befriend your fox man, they will only want to cover him in slime and then fly away.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: nope. im keeping him :p</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: its hard to explain</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: just some slight differences in personality i guess</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: he still raps sometimes.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: trust me, it hasn't.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i dont know if the differences are because he is a sprite</span>

<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: when was the last time you visited one in your sleep?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: and then, when i do dream about them, it's just kind of weird.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: either i'm alone in my own memory, talking to figments of my imagination...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: or i dream about someone we know. like a troll we have talked to, and i get excited.</span>

<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: well, i have kind of wondered to myself if you kept bringing that up because on some level you wanted that to be true...</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: jade, listen.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: at this point i could not give less of a rat's ass about romancey stuff!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i would rather just play some games, and chill out for several years on this magical flying boat. is that too much to ask?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: not at all! that is perfectly fine</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but that is IT.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: what?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you know. matters of the heart.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: *snicker*</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ok, you may laugh at my choice of words, but it is true.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it's really befuddling and distracting when you are on a major quest to make universes out of frogs. who even needs it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i guess you have a point</span>
<br />

<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you remember that troll girl who was sort of into me?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: well, ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: that seemed like a pretty big deal at the time!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it really seemed like she liked me, but also, she was *probably* insane?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: like, i mean, in a trollish, murderous kind of way.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: yikes</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but craziness notwithstanding, i didn't really know what to think.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i guess i thought she was cool at the time. i was honestly kind of flummoxed about it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but the point is, when all was said and done, that was just some stuff that happened over one day, which was a whole year ago already.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i barely even remember what we talked about. by the time we meet up, she probably won't give a shit about me at all.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: which, let's face it, is probably for the best.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: .....</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i think we make things more meaningful in our head when they're happening than they really are. like realistically? there were probably a lot of things that went on that day that didn't mean that much.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: like remember how you said you thought karkat was getting this silly angry crush on you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: that was just my hunch</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i mean, do you really think after three years he is still going to have the rage hots for you?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: at least</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i hope not ._.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i don't think even he is that crazy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: anyway, my point is, who even cares about all that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: romance and dating are dumb and boring. we are legendary heroes, and we have bigger fish to fry. like that smug fatass over there on the horizon.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: he sure looks pleased with himself. just look at him, he thinks he is the undisputed king of that mountain or something.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: that is so outrageous</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: follow me so we can seize the high ground against this hideous ocean dwelling marshmallow man, and steal all of his treasure.</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i know, right? that's what i think sometimes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it's strange combination of sci-fi things. like alien stuff is all about science, right? at least it is in movies. aliens LOVE science. but then ghosts have nothing to do with science, they belong to the supernatural realms, which have more to do with religion i guess? or about a lot of hocus pocus and superstition, maybe even magic. science rarely enters the equation, unless it's something awesome like ghost busters, which makes ghosts and stuff ALL ABOUT science, even though the ghost science is obviously a bunch of total nonsense. i guess contact mixes aliens and ghosts because jodie foster saw her ghost dad in outer space? but then, that was probably just a science projection from an alien, to make her feel less sad about her dead dad, and not a real ghost or anything. i guess the lesson is that science and aliens teach us that ghosts and religion are fake? although, it turns out ghosts and aliens are actually real, so maybe science and religion have been lying to us all along. *shrug*</span>

What's that, English? You look nervous. Could it be you weren't expecting me to know your only vulnerability? You have underestimated my omniscience almost as badly as I overestimate it as a matter of daily routine. Your reign of terror comes to an end here, on this balcony overlooking an enchanted cliffscape host to innumerable gorgeous stallions. How ironic, that your very demise would be in the proximity of some horses. What? You didn't follow that? Just think it over. Think it over...<br><br><br>

Ok, that gun looks super deudly. Way deudlier than the one I just threw at you, and I am probably screwed. But there is one thing you probably WEREN'T counting on, and that thing is magic being REAL.

Please let magic be real, please let magic be real, please let magic be real. I believe that magic is real right now. I believe so hard in its reality that it is becoming slightly less fake before our very eyes. I believe its fakeness was just a lie coughed up from a dark magician's spurious asshole. I believe in fairies. I believe dragons aren't bullshit. I believe heartily in the giggles of all the cherubs in heaven and the metric tonnes of special stardust they consume each day to fuel their laughter. I believe with the conviction of a million frothing zealots in the combined pranks of a billion leprechauns strong, and in the tiny erections they get from playing them. But most of all, I believe in YOU, Rufio.

Ok, what the FUCK are you going to do with all these stupid potions? Talk about buyer's remorse. You have had enough of this vulgar clown and his pushy potion peddling.

The clown says he can all motherfuckin abide about that. He doesn't want to get his step on to any motherfuckin toes. But he says if he's not going to be your guide, you gotta at least have SOMEONE as a guide, to all guide you on your way through this quest of miracles.

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's no big deal, since it's nothin' I wasn't planning on giving you anyway.</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, assuming I can actually send it today without another untimely paradoxification.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: If not, then hey, you get a sick grill full of birthday slime instead.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh hell no. HELL no man.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well listen. If youre going to send anything to me slime or otherwise can you please at least not make the shit appear directly over my head this time?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: The last thing i need on my bday is another installment of and i quote manbro bukkake theater.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You still don't actually know what that means, do you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Not really? Its your friggin figure of speech man. I gathered it just meant getting slimed like in ghost busters or somesuch.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Kind of. I told you to look it up.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yeah yeah. Im a busy fella dirk!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Wikipedia is a lot of letters to type in a thing for a man of action on the go.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Im always doing adventures remember?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That is such bullshit, you sit in your little jungle globe watching movies all day.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well yes. But ok i have a LOT of movies to bone up on. There are so many good ones i still havent seen.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You think literally every film you watch is a masterpiece. I've never felt so much vicarious shame through someone else's atrocious taste in awful garbage.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Screw you i have IMPECCABLE standards! Its just theres so much good stuff out there and ive really been on a roll with my picks lately.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Do you even hear yourself, dude?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Your &quot;picks&quot; are everything, and &quot;lately&quot; is always.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yes i hear myself just fine.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I hear a discriminating gentlemans melodious voice and it strikes my ears as the voice of reason! Heheh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Say heres one im pretty excited about. Have you heard about this avatar jam? Its coming out next year.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You mean the blue furry shit?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: No man it is not blue furry shit far from it. Get this. It is about this paralyzed fellow who is down on his luck and longs for adventure. And he finds it!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But it is far away on an enchanted planet rich with coveted treasures. And adventure is not all that he finds oh no. He also finds romance.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: A beautiful blue woman from the wild teaches him the ways of her savage culture and also the ways of alien love. Together they frolic in the forest whilst sharing primal intimacy through magic sexual escapades.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ahahahaha.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Whats so funny wise guy?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: To borrow from one of the more benighted sectors of your zeitgeist, that was &quot;so gay.&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Excuse me but i fail to see what could possibly be gay about some huge elegant blue men and women having really spiritual intercourse with their tails or something.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well yeah, obviously not literally.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Jake, where I'm from that word hasn't been used as a pejorative, or even much at all, in a really long fucking time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But youre from friggin texas! Arent you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes. But not exactly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Augh stop being such a cryptic troll all the time!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Anyway avatar looks spectacular and i think my preemptive review was spot on. The bloody end!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok but what you just said about those furries was gay as hell. It's time to face the facts.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You are just treating my great taste in flicks to your aloof hipstery disdain as usual. You dont know anything about that movie. Maybe youll like it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Nah, I saw it already. That movie sucked the smelliest shit from the ugliest butt. Sorry man.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well now i know youre just trolling me. It wont be out for another year!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Right.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Here, let me send you the rest of this robot already.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You've spent too long alone on that island as it is. I kinda worry about you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: A man can only spend so much time in the middle of the damn ocean with nothing but popcultural detritus and his own thoughts to keep him company.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Alrighty.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I hope it wont be as difficult to finish building as the rest was to assemble.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, just screw the thing on and it's ready to go.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Capital!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Scoot that noggin my way at your ready then.</span><br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Hehe. You nerd.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Hes got your slick japanese spectacles and everything.</span>

<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Why is this a metal man before me or is it none other than dirk strider himself in my room??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: One thing at a time, bro. I haven't quite figured out a way to get myself there yet.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: It almost sounds like this is something youve given some thought...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok well I don't know what you're implying there but why don't you snap that sucker on the torso and fire it up.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Affirmative.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I continue to boggle vacantly at your technical shenanigans.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Your knack for gadgetry seems to surpass even my grandmas and she was like this big time gizmo legend.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: How do you even do this stuff?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I guess from your perspective I must seem hells of &quot;overpowered&quot; in a bunch of ways.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Which I kind of am, like with a ninja sword I'm basically nuts, ok?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: If you say so buddy. I can believe it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, but when it comes to building stuff you're probably overstating things.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Like for example, if you told someone a hundred years ago you could build a computer they'd probably be like whoa shit, look at this fuckin' genius.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well actually first of all they'd say, what's a computer, I only know what horses and diseases are and shit like that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But once you actually tell them what computers are: Jesus dick! You're a wizard.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But from your perspective you know it's not a big deal to build a computer. You just go online and buy a case and a motherboard and some other shit and put it all together.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's not like you're smelting the goddamn silicon in your basement and making chips in your hermetically sealed, dust-free garage.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yeah but come on its not like youre from a century in the future.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well. No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Nor am i a quaint man of the past. Pardon me but do i SOUND like some trollycar bellwether toiling in the heart of the mustache belt from the ruff n tumble year of nineteen aught nine???</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: ...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: He said unironically.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Give me some credit man and some to yourself as well. You are too modest about all this robotics noise.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I don't know. I have a lot of time to work on stuff I guess.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: There are a lot of irons. You know where they are? Here's a hint. It's a pretty hot place.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: The kitchen?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Sure, I keep some irons there too. But most of them are in the fire.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh of course!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Fire is quite notoriously the hottest thing there is. A tip top locale for a whole mess of irons!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: True that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I actually have so much to do and think about, one of my current projects hopefully will address that very issue.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Gonna make an AI replica of my own mind. He can share some of the load. As well as make a decent intellectual sparring partner, ideally.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Not that my conversations with you aren't uniquely rad. But you know what I mean.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: See again i think you are downplaying a pretty neat accomplishment if you ask me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Shrug. We'll see.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Does that mean I'll have to deal with two dirks?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: One who is MORE MACHINE THAN MAN...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And another who is a computer program you made hahahahahahaha.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That's a super joke.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But I'm guessing you won't be hearing much from the program. It probably won't play a significant role in either of our lives.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I have my doubts it'll be a successful project, but who knows.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Id wager a tidy sum the results of the endeavor will be sensational.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I believe in you!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You do?</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You have helped me out a lot and been a good friend for ages.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Hmm.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well, I wasn't sure about doing this today, but if it's true that you do believe in me, then I guess fuck it, why not.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Why not what?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I guess call it an extra birthday present. But instead of a present that's awesome, consider it more like a weird confession that may change the way you feel about me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Whoa uh...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Dirk are you... uh...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Saying what i think?</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What do you think I'm saying here?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Should i sit down for this i dont know what to do.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Wait i already am sitting down. Maybe i should stand up?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, just chill out. Stand up, sit down, whatever. Here's the thing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You know all these painfully obvious hints I've been dropping? That always seem to be flying over your head?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Maybe?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I think i need a towel or something.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: About me being from the future.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh. Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I think so.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Well those weren't jokes. It's true.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What? Oh man are you actually serious??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So like...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You ARE from a century in the future.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No. More like four centuries.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The year 2422.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Or as we say contemporarily, 411 P.C.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Post Condescension.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: WOW.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I must say this is not the announcement i was expecting.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So you are a time traveler from 2422 here to help me build robots or something?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, I can't time travel. I can only send things through time, occasionally.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I actually live here in the future, alone in my apartment. I can send messages to you in the past though, like I'm doing now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: How?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Years ago our alien friend sent me a special chat client. It's basically just Pesterchum, with some sort of alien technology embedded.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's specifically wired to communicate with your time period. As hours go by for me, the time it sends messages to also increments by the same amount, so we communicate in lockstep. As if we both existed in the present.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She said it was important for Roxy and I to begin communicating with you and Jane. This is how we all became friends.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Wait... you and roxy?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes. She lives in the future too. Though we live nowhere near each other.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I asked her to refrain from telling either of you. I wanted to be the one to let you know. To wait for the right moment.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Holy fucking mackerel. This is amazing!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You really are trusting me about this? Just like that? No second thought?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well yeah. Sure man why not? Wait its not a prank is it?!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: This would be a very shitty and boring &quot;prank.&quot; I promise it isn't.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Then heck yes i believe it to friggin pieces. Its an awesome thing to be true!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Haha.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So whats the far flung future like? Some sort of crazy robo paradise?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Not quite, but there are definitely robots.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh man what are your movies like in the future?? I bet there are some real cinematic humdingers. Like holographic stuff? Or shit you plug directly into your brain pod right? Wait you do have brain pods right?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No. We don't have brain pods because those aren't a thing, you just made that up. And there are no movies in the future.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: There are no humans either. They all went extinct.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Roxy and I are the only ones left, as far as we know.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well shit.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Dirk this story got so much less awesome.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Is it too late to backpedal on believing it before i start to cry?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No dude, it's too late. Tears ahoy, this motherfucker gets sad.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Do you want to know what happened?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Sure do.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Don't worry, that's normal.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Stalking mode??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes. He will stalk you in the jungle and strike when your guard is down.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What? Thats crazy why would i want that!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Didn't you want someone to get in scrums with?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well yeah but... man.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I guess youre right.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I was just picturing a little good honest rough housing... why does the whole thing have to sound so sketchy and nerve wracking!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Do you want to hear my grim tales of the apocalypse or not?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yes!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Youre right lets put issues of fisticuffs aside for now. Tell me everything about the future.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So how does humanity fuck up? Is it the nuclear holocaust? Or is it robots? Gotta be the robots right? As per the terminator.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, it's more of a gradual decline in population than that, due to an insidious power grab by an aquatic alien empress.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh the old alien overlord story? Got it. When does she show up?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She's already there, in your time period, hiding in plain sight. She has been for anywhere between fifty and a hundred years.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She's the Baroness of Crockercorp. Jane's company. But of course Jane has no idea.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The Baroness has been using subtle strategies to manipulate the human population through her company for a long time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: On November 11th, 2011, she finally made her presence known to the world, along with her agenda for global domination.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Jeez that is pretty scary. So in a few years she will be in charge of everything?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, not quite. That's just when the world finally sees her for the threat she is. She would continue to gain power by exploiting various institutions and the media from within.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It would take the next several decades for her to claim the throne as Earth's absolute ruler. Her march to domination was facilitated by a number of scumbag sympathizers, and opposed by a few brave rebels, including my ancestor. Roxy's too.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I think your ancestor qualifies as one too. In fact I'm sure she must have been the first member of the covert opposition movement.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: My grandma?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I do remember when i was very young she would tell me stories of the wicked woman who raised her.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Was she the evil alien?</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That's a whole story right there, most of which is shrouded in rumor and urban legend.</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Nobody at the time knew what the fuck she wanted to accomplish or what her actual motives were.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But in retrospect it became clear she was trying to essentially restore the conditions of her old home world, which she used to rule over as well.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She began instituting these crazy laws. First of all, people weren't allowed to reproduce. She found our usual method of procreation revolting, and anyone who engaged in it was punished by death.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But she still needed an ongoing population of subjects to abuse, so to propagate the race she set up this weird system.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: At random intervals every citizen would be required to supply their genetic material to drones. That DNA would be collected and combined in some way.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Many years later, long after the original donors had died, clones would be spawned from their DNA. So no one would ever be able to know who their &quot;parents&quot; were, or be able to trace their lineage.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It was only through a bit of good fortune that Roxy and I were able to discover who our ancestors were.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: They were the rebels you mentioned? Are they alive right now?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I mean in my time?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh! I am very curious about them and also my grandma.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'll get to them, don't worry.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Anyway, &quot;Her Imperious Condescension&quot; turned out to be especially cruel to her human subjects. I'm sure her rule was no picnic on her home world, but I think she resented humans' biological incompatibility with the ideal empire she envisioned, and became frustrated.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Humanity wasn't even really her first choice for rule. There are reports that she attempted to clone members of her own species and replace the human population with them. But they all died.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What happened to them?</span><br><br><br>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The rumors say it was her own &quot;pet&quot; who killed them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: See, she traveled from her world to Earth in this huge red space ark.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: In it she had gathered thousands of creatures from her planet, I'm guessing to save them from extinction.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: This more than anything has led me to speculate that some cataclysm happened on her home world, and she moved on to greener pastures to rebuild her empire.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She bred all these creatures in secret, increasing their numbers, preparing for her eventual takeover.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Each monster, or &quot;lusus naturae,&quot; was meant to be kind of a caretaker of the young. You can see where the dramatic schism between our species and hers begins, and also why she had a reputation for being quite insane.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But she also happens to have this one humongous sea monster lusus that is like her own personal bodyguard, and kind of a secret weapon.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But it turns out the thing is kind of an enigma. Sort of a double edged eldritch horror. As much in her service as it is calling the shots, in some unfathomable way.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Every time she tried to resurrect her race, it would slaughter them all psychically. As if it was keeping her ambition in check.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Or so the story goes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Wait... these beasts tend to the young??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I can tell you from first hand experience that monsters are totally rotten at taking care of kids!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: They do a bangup job of making em scared though. :(</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Exactly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The plan was beyond shitty.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So does that mean you and rox were raised by these things?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Nope.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It was a very short lived experiment centuries ago.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Humans just don't have the same evolutionary symbiosis with those things that her race had.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It turns out a bunch of fuckin' alien monsters have no interest whatsoever in taking care of human babies.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: They mostly just wound up eating them, or at best, just abandoning them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Later she instated a lusidroid system to serve the same function, as she began phasing in more robotic solutions in favor of all this ill conceived biotech nonsense that always did nothing but backfire.</span><br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Even drones were replaced with robotic versions. I imagine they were just easier to produce and control, since she'd given up hope of perfectly mirroring her own civilization in all its convoluted symbiotic glory.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But not without a good fight, and not without taking her frustrations out on the human population.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She attempted to enforce &quot;blood casting&quot; through efforts to genetically alter people's blood color. That was an ugly chapter. Lotta fuckin' people died from that debacle.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Over the last four hundred years, the population just got smaller and smaller from these atrocities piling up. But she clearly didn't give a shit.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: All the while, the amount of dry land kept shrinking due to the gradual flooding.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Soon there was hardly anywhere left to live, and then, that was that. No more people.</span>
<br />

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Oh. Yeah, I probably should have mentioned this up front.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: One of the first things she did while in power was begin melting the ice caps.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It took a while, but eventually the whole world flooded.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That's how it is now. It's totally soaked up in this bitch.</span>

<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Wow like the epic kevin costner film?</span>

<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Wait the whatsits?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Right. Another thing I forgot to mention.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: There are a lot of these humanoid creatures with hard shells. Some black, some white.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: As humanity was dwindling due to an increasingly whimsical and psychopathic Condesce, she began introducing more of these Carapacians on to the scene.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Are they aliens too?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Uh...</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But the bottom line is at some point, somehow, she started herding a bunch of them from their home worlds on to Earth and multiplying them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Something like a hundred years ago it became clear she favored these guys more than humans as her subjects.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: They're very loyal and seem genuinely dedicated to serving her. Must be what they were bred for. She still treats them like shit though, unsurprisingly.</span>

<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Cripes the things she told me now that i think about it. She said the witch even killed her dog!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Is that true?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I don't know, but wouldn't doubt it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: There are other urban legends that she did a lot of experiments on animals and people. Mostly to do with mind control.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Like figuring out ways to unlock all of her psychic alien potential, to increase her power.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Not sure if that's true, or if it was actually successful though.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So what youre saying is pretty much any unspeakably horrible thing she could have done she probably did?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Anyway, your grandma managed to run away when she was quite young. Maybe it was a traumatic event like dog murder that prompted her to flee, who knows.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Whatever the case, her bro stayed behind. The guy must have been seriously immune to witnessing fucked up shit, because he went on to be a famous comedian. A real kindly old cornball. A nicer guy you couldn't hope to meet, they say.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Haha wow. Must have been a hell of a guy.</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Famous comedian, about the age of your grandma, inheriting the family name of the Baroness...</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok, well it's not like it's that important. Just a super obvious thing that'll probably occur to you later when you're looking in the fridge you don't have, at which point you'll feel like an idiot.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh my god you can be one opaque motherfucker just clue me in bro!</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That kid kept the family name but obviously your grandma didn't.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She must've held a grudge against the Baroness her whole life. She started by taking a different name she knew would stick in her craw.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh! I remember this.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I believe she said the witch used to be married to a terrible man named english.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So because the witch really hated that guy she took on his name as sort of a big ole fuck you to the woman?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That's probably close to the truth, but it sounds like the kind of story an old lady tells her young grandson in a way he would understand. Or at least wouldn't scare the shit out of him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What I've read is something much more sinister, as usual.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: There's supposedly only one thing the Baroness fears, and your grandma learned of this somehow.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It wasn't an ex husband though. It was her superior. Some kind of demon, or another alien, no one really knows. But he went by the name English. He's supposedly even more brutal than she is, if you can believe that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So im named after a demon? What kind of demon is named english anyway?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What kind of alien is named Crocker? It's probably just a name he stole from someone else, like the Baroness did.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I guess its kind of cool being named after a demon whos so scary even the witch is afraid of him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, well, your grandma thought so.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Everything she did in life thereafter seemed to be in effort to piss off the batterwitch.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Like starting a competing tech company, heavily branded in a way that was presumably intended to remind the Baroness of her boss.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Like with skulls and garish colors and shit. The dude is some kind of skull monster I guess?</span>
<br />

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It was definitely brave on her part, but ultimately it got her a bankrupt company, a blown up house, and a fork through the torso for her trouble.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But she must have been the first to understand how dangerous the Baroness was, while acting in covert opposition.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Others would follow, and continue to as of now, in your time period.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Gadzooks of course!!!</span>

<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: With all your future mindfuckery you made me completely forget about your vaunted hollywood sibling.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I shoulda asked where he fit into the picture if you were raised alone. I can be dumb as a bag of penny candy sometimes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Sometimes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Other times you're on point, like a bag of the nickel shit.</span>

<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Right. So then he was never actually your bro?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, that's just kind of how I view him.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Phooey to that. Like i even believe you!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The books are pretty interesting though, if somewhat dense.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: They're supposedly heavily allegorical. Veiled representations of cosmic events surrounding the witch and her boss and how all this came about.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's the kind of thing you wouldn't pick up on unless you were someone who understood what happened, like the Condesce, which was kind of the point. I think it was her way of letting the witch know, &quot;I'm on to you.&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: In the early days of the resistance movement they both opposed her more indirectly, through their art, like critics of tyrannical governments often used to.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: They had to be careful. Didn't want to make big waves too early.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: My bro did this too with his many fine films.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Practically everything was a symbol for something. Either in mockery of the batterwitch, or conveying some hidden message to its audience. Each film was always rigorously picked apart for its head-scratching symbolic meaning.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But he managed to accomplish all that without ever compromising the purity of his ironic vision, which I think was admirable.</span><br><br><br>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, you pretty much touche'd the fuck out of that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But we are definitely in agreement about my bro's films as the masterstrokes they were.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: He just kept cranking them out, too. He really stepped up production after 11/11/11, even though the cat was finally out of the bag. He was very dedicated to his craft.</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The key to sorting it all out is to understand it doesn't actually matter.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Through video streaming services he would frequently set it up so that buying a certain title would ship you the wrong film.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And often titles for movies were available for sale that just straight up didn't exist. Or would be sold for dollar amounts that made no sense, like $2.890.1. And sometimes buying a download would actually deposit money into your account instead of deducting from it.</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: He left some supplies for me here. Like a lifetime supply of orange soda in the crawl space, along with a fuck ton of SBaHJ merch. It was like discovering my own personal holocaust of bulbous jutting bottoms.</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: As I mentioned, Crockercorp's rebranding on 3-11, as it was often referred to in the news, totally changed everything.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It marked the beginning of a completely shameless downward spiral of western civilization, through a series of events that were probably hard to notice at the time, but quite glaring when evaluated historically.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Though the Baroness made very few substantive gestures of aggression, the global fear of her looming threat would trigger all the changes she needed.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Governments prepared for war, as if to defend against the invading alien armies she undoubtedly commanded.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: He somehow landed on the U.S. Supreme Court. Over the years, other justices started mysteriously disappearing without being replaced.</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But everyone just thought he toked too hard on the colonial cannabis or whatever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Im not sure i follow. These are like clown presidents or such?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yes. They were a shitty rap duo from your time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But they ran a hell of a campaign. By then the juggalo party had gotten huge. While the numerous other candidates split the moderate vote, they retained a very energized and devoted base.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You could say their party had a big tent.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Dirk i really dislike the future you are describing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Hey me too.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: They were swept into office on a wave of Faygo, and the presidential inauguration was the biggest Gathering of the Juggalos of all time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: They all hosed each other down on the Whitehouse lawn with shitty soda. The &quot;D.C.&quot; in the capital thereafter officially stood for &quot;Dark Carnival.&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Of course their campaign was helped considerably by having support from the Baroness.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: In retrospect, people developed the impression that it was all a part of her sick sense of humor.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: There was this sense that she just loved the idea of delegating the extreme subjugation of the world's population to a pair of demented clown rappers.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Some have speculated this was just another way she was attempting to resurrect her previous model of governance, though this seems kinda far fetched to me.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Don't worry about it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: People were less prepared for a double juggalo presidency than they ever imagined.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'm not even going to get into all the horrifying details. Trust me, you just start to feel dirty reading about it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: From the moment Fieri held up the bible to swear them in, and the three of them proceeded to publically defecate on it while freestyling rap lyrics...</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The next several grueling terms of their presidency was a weird combination of authoritarian practices. The Baroness used it as a puppet regime, while still basically giving them carte blanche to carry out their idiotic whims.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Faygo was pumped through the plumbing instead of tap water. The new national pastime was having type 2 diabetes. And the national anthem was replaced by a 3 minute high-reverb audio clip of President Jay farting into a microphone while laughing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Chaplain Fieri was authorized to set up the death camps, in which anyone on the planet could be imprisoned if they were not deemed sufficiently &quot;mirthful.&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And so the cleansing began, priming humanity for its new ruler waiting in the wings.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: This was when our ancestors had enough.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The resistance movement had failed, but they could at least bring the war criminals to justice.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: My bro finally caught up with the presidents and challenged them to a duel.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: They accepted, having for years regarded him as a cocky rival rapper who failed to show them the proper respect. In their arrogance they invited him into the foul belly of the Carnival believing they could teach him once and for all what it truly meant to be down with the clown.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: For centuries thereafter, survivors of the Hilarocaust would cite the rooftop showdown as one of the most heroic moments in human history.</span><br><br><br>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: With all her high ranking officers dead, and the human population decimated and sufficiently groomed for her arrival, there was no reason to stay behind the scenes anymore.</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You do realize he's coming for you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Dirk. In the real world. The man has his designs.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yes. I know.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Wanna talk about it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: With you? No!! Thats like...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Thats like talking to him about it which is like really jumping the gun i think.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What better chance is there to try talking about it than with a stunt double for your hyper-aggressive suitor within the safety and privacy of your own mind?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But i cant yet! I just cant.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: There are some feelings im not sure how to put into words yet and doing it in front of you whether youre a stunt double or brain puppet or whatever it just makes me feel uncomfortable!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So there are feelings you don't want to try to put into words, even while you are dwelling entirely within the realm of your own mind?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What is so hard to understand about that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What about the spider ghost?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Huh?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The girl you saw.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: When you got fucking clobbered by Dirk's robot and you passed out.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You dreamed about a spider ghost alien girl.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh yeah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What about her?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You like her.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Man what?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Thats dumb i saw her for three seconds and she waved at me and i woke up!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah, and it took all of three seconds for you to fall in love with the cute spider ghost.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Why do you keep calling her a ghost??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Cause she's been dead for a zillion years, dude.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh. Well.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Holy shit?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That won't change the fact that you like her, let's not pretend it will.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You're going to make things complicated for yourself.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: No i wont.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah you will. You're too fuckin' wishy washy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Between Dirk, spider ghost, Jane...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Man, poor Jane.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What? What about jane?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You tell me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What was even the deal with that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Our last chat ended on very pleasant and amicable terms! She was upbeat and chipper as ever. I fail to see what reason one might have to feel sorry for her.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Uh, yeah. You totally read her like a book.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Really handled that conversation like a champ.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Wait... didnt i?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Look out bitches. It's Jake &quot;Casanova Ladyslayer&quot; English. He's packing heat, and is frequently able to parse the literal meaning of things women say.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What are you getting at!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: We're running out of time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She'll be here soon.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Jane?!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No, doofus.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Spider ghost.</span>

<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Where? Wait. She is??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh fuck.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Look at you. I'm telling you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Three damn seconds of ogling an alien in a blue dress, and you're completely hopeless.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Stop fidgeting around like that. Your hair looks fine.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Do you want me to tell you how your breath smells?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Screw you!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I am cool as SUCH a cucumber.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok then.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Uh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Why does my breath not smell ok?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You're dreaming, Jake.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Your breath is only a thing if your brain wants it to be.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh okay whew.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: When is she coming? Why is she visiting my dreams?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Soon.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: She's been waiting for the right time to enter. Waiting for you to snap out of the memory.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Clearly the girl has the patience of a saint.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Alright...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Dang! Its warm in this dream bubble. How can i be sweating in a dream??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Where do i keep the dream towels...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Will you calm the fuck down?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'm a figment of your imagination, and you're still making me nervous.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But really who is she? Whats her deal and what does she want from me?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Since all this so called untapped potential in my subconscious taking the form of yet another sassy dirk clone seems to know everything would it be ok if i troubled my own brain for a few flipping answers???</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You should try to be more polite to me. Seeing as I am a representation of your entire mind, I have complete control over all your basic functions.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I could trigger a particularly spirited bowel movement right before she gets here, so watch your step.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Augh no no no im sorry im sorry dont!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Just kidding, dude. Jesus.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I would never make you shit your pants in front of a girl you liked, even if she does happen to be my chief competition.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: We Dirk splinters can be pretty Machiavellian but we do actually have some fuckin' standards.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Okay. Thank you for promising to keep my trousers tidy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Anyway, she's visiting now to bring you into the loop on some things.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Important details you should know about your relation to the bigger picture.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: The much, much bigger picture.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I still dont understand how you know... or excuse me MY BRAIN knows this stuff. Because im a page? How does that make sense?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And also if you know the things she will say why dont you just tell me the things?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Intuition and the subconscious mind are powerful things when harnessed the right way.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: As for why I don't tell you, why not just let her tell you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You're the one with the damn crush on her.</span><br><br><br>

 <b> 04/30/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006778">"Jack: Start Jailbreak Adventure."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You wake up locked in a deserted jail cell, completely alone. There is nothing at all in your cell, useful or otherwise.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/30/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006779">"Jack: Attempt to pry open window."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
There are no objects around with which to &quot;pry open window&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
Look at that. This frame is precisely identical to the previous frame. You advanced nothing whatsoever with that dumb idea.
<br />

<br />
Do you realize this adventure is nearing 5000 panels? And now we have to watch you flounder around in a jail cell for god knows how long? Exactly how many panels do you want this to go on for? Over 9000? Nobody wants that. Nobody even wants to hear <span style="font-style: italic">the phrase</span> &quot;over 9000.&quot;
<br />

<br />
You need to begin making better decisions if you want to escape.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/30/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006780">"Jack: Get key."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
What did you not understand about the statement, &quot;There is nothing at all in your cell, useful or otherwise.&quot;
<br />

<br />
There is no key.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/30/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006781">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It is an extremely crude drawing of a key on the floor. Really, the drawing is so bad, it's ridiculous to think that some prankster thought it would fool you, which it did. Whoever drew this key clearly was employing the most primitive drawing tools available. 
<br />

<br />
You are obviously being fucked with in this stupid jail cell. You expect that you will continue to be fucked with, and it makes you wish you could stab something.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/30/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006782">"Jack: Get pumpkin."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
WHAT FUCKING PUMPKIN. THERE IS NO PUMPKIN. ONCE AGAIN, THERE IS NOTHING AT ALL IN YOUR CELL, USEFUL OR oh god dammit.
<br />

<br />
Ok, a pumpkin appears. You guess it must be feeding time for the prisoners. These Prospitian jails are like luxury suites compared to the penal system on Derse. Should be the softest time you ever did.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/30/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006783">"Jack: Consume pumpkin."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
What a horrible idea. You don't eat fresh produce. The thought is revolting to you. What do you think these sharp teeth are for? Or, what's left of them at least.
<br />

<br />
You'll have to make a note to file a protest with your lawyer. Complain of cruel and unusual treatment. Their coddling criminal justice system will undoubtedly see to it you are given some proper meat to consume. Perhaps a prime cut of filet mignon, as if you are a guest of honor. What a bunch of powder puffs, with all their namby pamby morals and compassion. This kingdom makes you sick.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/30/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006784">"Jack: Look out window."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You step up on the little curby thing to get a better look outside. Can't make a plan without getting your bearings.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/30/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006785">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
A lone sentry is on duty below. You shout a few obscenities his way. You wonder aloud what a guy has to do to get a decent meal around here. Hey, you're TALKING to that guy. It's no use though. He ignores you.
<br />

<br />
Just look at that stoic face. The unshakeable discipline. The stalwart sense of duty and pride. This is what it means to be a member of the Prospitian Royal Guard. 
<br />

<br />
What a load of shit, you grumble to yourself, but loud enough for him to hear.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/30/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006786">"Jack: Inspect pumpkin."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
That guy won't be of any use. You doubt you could even manage to lure him into your pissing radius, magnificent though it is.
<br />

<br />
You give the pitiful gourd a little kick. A terrible thought occurs to you. What if you have no choice but to eat this awful thing? You can't let it come to that. You have to get out of here.
<br />

<br />
Hold on, what's that...<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/30/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006787">"Jack: Take a closer look."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Eureka. Droll you beautiful bastard.
<br />

<br />
Looks like he snuck something inside the pumpkin to help you escape. Probably a bomb. You are going to have to remember to give him a promotion when you get out of here. Or at least reduce his daily newspaper floggings.
<br />

<br />
Need to think of a way to get the bomb out of there. Can't just smash it with your foot, or it might explode and take your leg off. Too bad they confiscated your knives or you could slice the thing open neatly. Maybe even carve a funny face into it. Heh heh, you bet you're the first guy who ever thought of doing that.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/01/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006788">"Jack: Search for carving apparatus."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Hang on. You remember seeing some pointy things just outside the window. 
<br />

<br />
Luckily both kingdoms are totally covered in pointy things. Can't swing a dead cat without impaling it on one.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/01/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006789">"Jack: Take pointy thing."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You snap off a golden pointy thing. Should be sharp enough to do the trick.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/01/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006790">"Jack: Carve pumpkin."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It slices through the meat of the vegetable like a sharp spire through thick squash. This is working so well. Who the hell needs a trusty knife when you are this resourceful? Screw knives!
<br />

<br />
You take it back, you can't stay mad at knives.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/01/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006791">"Jack: Open it."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You can taste your liberation already. You can't wait to hear the sweet ticking of the bomb that is definitely in there. That will be the sound of freedom, you decide.
<br />

<br />
You pull off the lid to reveal...<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/01/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006792">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
A whole bunch of knives.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/01/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006793">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
God DAMN it, Droll.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/01/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006794">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
He's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although now that you think about it, he might be by default, since he just sent you all the sharpest tools in the shed.
<br />

<br />
Oh well, you can probably get some use out of these. You've never once been disappointed to receive a pumpkin full of knives, and you're not about to make an exception.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/01/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006795">"Jack: Empty pumpkin on floor."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You take a quick inventory of the smuggled contraband. 
<br />

<br />
Hold on. Looks like he snuck something else in the pumpkin under all the knives. Something... compromising.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/01/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006796">"Jack: Examine compromising material."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The Droll knows what it's like spending long, cold nights alone in the clink. A man needs a little reading material to keep him company, if you know what he means.
<br />

<br />
If your skin wasn't made of polished jet black carapace, your cheeks would be turning bright red. No one can ever know about this. You must destroy the evidence. Or disguise it somehow.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/01/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006797">"Jack: Forge blade out of illicit literature."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
None shall be the wiser. It is the perfect crime.
<br />

<br />
When you bust out of prison, you should be locked right back up again because of how perfect this crime is.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/01/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006798">"Jack: Throw a knife down there to get that guy's attention."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
That should get the guy's attention.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/01/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006799">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Unfortunately it only keeps his attention until he dies, which is almost instantly.
<br />

<br />
You need to come up with a better plan. While you would argue that random stabbings are their own reward, they aren't getting you any closer to escape.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/01/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006800">"Jack: Examine exit."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
That door is locked tight. You're going to need a key to open it. Preferably one that isn't horribly drawn on the floor to taunt you.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/01/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006801">"Jack: Knock on door."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Maybe if you knock hard enough, in just the right way, at just the right time...
<br />

<br />
Wait for it... wait for it... 
<br />

<br />
Wait, no. Not yet.
<br />

<br />
Wait for it...
<br />

<br />
Wait...
<br />

<br />
...<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/01/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006802">"Jack: Now."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your clumsy fist accidentally flies through the bars, knocking out a passer-by. Keys from his key ring jangle on the floor.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/01/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006803">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It's quite possible one of those keys will unlock your door. But they are all well out of reach now. 
<br />

<br />
What next, genius?<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/02/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006804">"Jack: Use knife to snag one of the keys on the floor."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You see if a knife can adequately lengthen your reach. But it's no use! They're still just outside of your modest slashing radius.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/02/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006805">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
No dice. Need a different approach. 
<br />

<br />
Wait a minute. Another guard notices your unauthorized tomfoolery and radios for backup.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/02/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006806">"Jack: Beckon other guard over."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
He looks none too pleased by your misbehavior. This will surely result in reduced rations. You can expect to find a slightly smaller pumpkin in your cell come Skaia rise, mister.
<br />

<br />
You keep beckoning him. Just a little closer. A little closer...<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/02/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006807">"Jack: Convince second guard to pick up keys for you."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You use a little &quot;persuasion&quot; to see if you can get him too... Jack, no!!!
<br />

<br />
That is not how you convince someone to do something. You're supposed to save the stabbing until AFTER you intimidate him into doing what you want! How exactly is a dead guy supposed to pick up some keys for you?!<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006808">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Real smooth, Jack. What's the plan now? To bury the keys under a growing pile of torsos? This is turning out to be the second shittiest jailbreak attempt anyone has ever seen.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006809">"Jack: Look around room."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The only remaining thing in the room worth noting is in the other corner of your cell. Just a transport pad prisoners are supposed to use as a waste receptacle. These were decommissioned in Derse prisons a long time ago. Too many prisoner suicides, and severed heads showing up in the waste bins. None of those auto-decapitations were authorized with the right paperwork, so privileges had to be suspended.
<br />

<br />
You hear the door open and slam shut. Someone else is in your cell.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006810">"Jack: Welcome guest."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Looks like the sentry phoned downstairs for a little muscle. It's one of the regulator lugs they use to keep the gen pop in line. This guy has an itchy baton wrist and that look in his eye you know all too well. He's not leaving this room until one of you is good and bloody.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006811">"Jack: Be the other guy."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You attempt to be this guy down here but you can't be this guy down here because he's dead. 
<br />

<br />
But it does serve as a convenient cutaway for the vicious beating that is currently taking place in your cell. We don't need to be watching that kind of prison brutality. We take our sweet time looking at this dead body while terrible noises can be heard from your prison window.
<br />

<br />
Ok that should be long enough. You can stop being this guy now.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006812">"Jack: Stop being that guy."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You stop being the other guy in time for us to see that you have just finished quickly and cleanly subduing the... 
<br />

<br />
Jack.
<br />

<br />
Jack, the man is dead. Stop that.
<br />

<br />
Jack.
<br />

<br />
Jack.
<br />

<br />
Jack.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006813">"Jack: Apologize to guard's body."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You start to feel sorry for stabbing that guy with 7 knives in the back and bashing his face into the door 89 times. Well, maybe not all 89 times. For the first 88 you felt pretty good. But by the 89th face bashing, you were definitely starting to feel pretty sorry.
<br />

<br />
And by sorry, you guess you mean bored.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, you mutter something under your breath that could EASILY sound like an apology to someone who wasn't listening very well.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006814">"Jack: Give guy a proper funeral."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Whatever the state of your contrition might be, there can be no question about it. A man dedicated to royal service deserves a proper and dignified funeral.
<br />

<br />
However, since there is no casket in your cell that is nearly big enough for this lug's hefty torso, you will have to improvise.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006815">"Jack: Seek alternative casket."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You sever the guard's head with your most trusted of all trusty knives, and begin sizing up that hollowed pumpkin. 
<br />

<br />
It will definitely be snug, but you think you can make it fit.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006816">"Jack: Make it fit."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You don't care what anyone says. You say this pumpkin was MADE for this fucker's melon. Fits like a damn glove.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006817">"Jack: Close it up."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Perfect. A textbook burial for a man of honor and distinction.
<br />

<br />
The sacrifices made by our public servants don't get anywhere near the respect they deserve, you think.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006818">"Jack: Bring casket over to receptacle."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
His funeral will not be complete without a proper sendoff.
<br />

<br />
But a stinking garbage dump is no place for the head of a brave soldier to rest. No, you must first make some modifications to the device. Doing hard time behind bars will motivate a man to learn a trick or two when it comes to systems like this.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006819">"Jack: Pry open panel with knife."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You open it up and switch a few wires around. There. Now instead of a nasty old pile of rotting pumpkin matter, the destination should be the throne room of the Prospitian palace! Surely the queen will want to be alerted to the noble sacrifice of this brave warrior so that arrangements can be made to honor the hero.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006820">"Jack: Send him off."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006821">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006822">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You hear the door open again, followed by the sound of surly footsteps. Could it be that another glutton for a good face bashing has decided to visit your cell?<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006823">"Jack: Greet visitor."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Ah. You see. It appears there are quite a few said gluttons this time. Settle down, gentlemen. There are more than enough face bashings to go around.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006824">"Jack: Quick, be the other guy again."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You be the other guy again while they beat you senseless.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/09/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006825">"Other guy: Be Jake."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Suddenly you aren't the other guy anymore. You couldn't quite be the other guy anyway since he's dead, even though deadness hasn't really stopped us from being guys before.
<br />

<br />
Nevertheless, the dead guy starts being Jake, who is not a dead guy. Well, his dream self is dead. But his non-dead non-dream self isn't, and that's the guy we're being, a guy who is asleep. That non-dead sleeping guy is presently talking to a non-sleeping dead ancient spider ghost, who long ago earned the achievement badge, GIFT OF GAB, and boy does she know how to use it.<br><br><br>

<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: ...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I think I've spent enough time introducing myself! You have hardly said a word.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: It would 8e nice to know whether my long story has confounded you in any particular way, or if you are just 8eing shy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Uh...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Yes?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Jake, I understand this is very much to learn all at once, 8ut do you really want me to keep speaking until I am 8lue in the face?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: ...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Gulp!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: You appear to 8e perspiring heavily.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: There is no reason to 8e so nervous, especially considering you are only dreaming.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Shit!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Sorry. I dont know where i put the dream towels.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: It's ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Well, at the risk talking a8out myself a little more, I feel it would 8e dishonest not to confess.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: What?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I am a fairly gifted psychic.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Whoa really?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Like you can see the future?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Are they ghost powers or troll powers? Or wait shucks thats a dumb sounding question.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: No, that was a fine question. They're troll powers. Sometimes those of my 8lood type will have them naturally.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: And no, they are not prognosticative a8ilities. They let me access another's mind in a way that can 8e terri8ly invasive if a8used.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Invasive?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Yes. Including the a8ility to control minds, when exploited fully.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Uh oh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: 8ut don't worry. They don't seem to work the same way on your species. They're considera8ly weaker.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: The most I can do is get an empathic impression of your emotional state.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: So if I speculate that you are shy or nervous, it is 8ecause I can sense that you are.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Aw man youre kidding!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: So much for trying to be cool i guess.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Although i probably blew that when you saw me yelling at nobody about boners and stuff.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I wouldn't say you 8lew it, 8ut that was certainly odd.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Who were you talking to, if you don't mind my asking?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: That was like...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: The brain ghost memory splinter of my best friend dirk who is stuck in my head and you cant see.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: And he was kinda hassling me and trying to get me to talk to him about how his real self has a thing for me but i kind of think it would be weird to talk to his brain impostor about that? At least for now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: And then you showed up and you caught me at an awkward moment where he was threatening to make some bodily functions happen in front of you as a joke which would have been embarrassing as all blasted heck.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: But now it turns out you can read my mind too so im surrounded by brain invaders!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: You seem cool aranea but uh when am i going to wake up?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I am not a 8rain invader though!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I said I can only sense your emotions. I think it's polite to let people know 8efore long. Otherwise I 8egin to feel a 8it underhanded.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Ok. I guess thats not too bad.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: I think i can keep my feelings buttoned up. That is what strong and adventurous gentlemen do i think. They keep a stiff upper lip even on the inside. That way they are never embarrassed and feel slightly more brave about stuff.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: 8ut you don't have to! That was not the point of my telling you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I'm used to sensing many things from people. There aren't any feelings you could have that would 8e that surprising to me or compromising to you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I really just want you to relax for the 8rief time we have in this 8u88le and talk to me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Um gotcha.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: But what should i talk about?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Well, I have spent almost no time examining this iteration of your universe.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: The gods have given me very little access to it through the memories of others until now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I 8elieve they are finally 8eginning to 8ridge the divides 8etween long estranged compartments of reality, allowing previously unintroduced parties to mingle.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Those from different universes, 8oth their initial iterations and their scratched re8oots. Those from different spheres, ones of creative potential and of mortality.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Through us all they attempt to 8ring closure to unsanctioned loops and restore sta8ility to the cosmos.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: So I am curious a8out you and your friends. What is your life like?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: My life?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Its mostly just me sitting around here watching movies and stuff and sometimes polishing firearms.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I understand. The same is mostly true for myself.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I can sense that you are either very impressed or in some way intimidated 8y me, 8ut when it comes down to the 8asics, a description of my life would 8e 8oring as well.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Why don't you show me around?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Show you around my room? Yes ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Well. There are some guns. Like i said guns are great.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: There is a whole mess of movie posters on the wall. You probably never heard of any of them being a dead alien and such.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Actually I do 8elieve it would 8e within the scope of my a8ilities to get you to wake up.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: 8ut do you really want me to do that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Um... maybe?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: If it is true that you think I am attractive then why wouldn't you want to spend a little more time here with me? What's the harm?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Are you really in such a hurry to leave and feel sorry for yourself, for no explica8le reason?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Well...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I already told you, Jake.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I am used to sensing many different types of feelings.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: It's given me a different perspective on emotions than most have.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: For most, the feelings of others are often a mystery. So they are prone to speculation and paranoia a8out the motivations of people they meet.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: The emotions of others can seem like such well guarded mysteries, people 8egin to 8elieve that's how their own emotions should 8e treated as well. So when someone can read their thoughts easily it feels like a violation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: 8ut to one accustomed to reading those thoughts, there isn't the same perception of violation or secrecy. It's more like examining other self evident facts a8out a person, like taking note of their appearance.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: It's still hard for non-psychics to understand this though, even if you explain it to them. It can lead to some awkward relationships, unfortunately.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: I imagine it would.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: So...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Youve sensed it when other fellas have had the hots for you eh?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Fellows, yes. And ladies. It's happened.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Yowza!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: You mustve been popular i guess.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Haha! Oh no. No, not really.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: The fact that I've 8een the fleeting o8ject of attraction to a handful really paints the wrong social picture I'm afraid.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: That is hard to believe.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: It's my experience that people very often underestimate their own lika8ility. I sense that feeling all the time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Pro8a8ly 8ecause they're in the dark a8out others' thoughts. They are usually in dou8t, so they frequently err on the side of pessimism.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: In many cases they would 8e surprised if they knew how many around them were open to friendship, or possi8ly something more.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I would venture that if you had such a sense you even might 8e surprised yourself!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Ha! Thats a laugh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: I am quite sure my only suitor is my best bro and even then he is such a jumbled stupid puzzle of unfathomable ironies im not even sure about THAT half the time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: I wish i had your powers that would be top notch. Id be parked on the corner of relationship lane and EASY STREET.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: I could kick back in my eligible bachelors limousine and never fuck up or ever say anything awkward like i have been doing non stop so far in this dream.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Let's not get carried away. That certainly does not descri8e my experience.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: You would think 8eing a8le to sense the occasional attraction from others would 8e advantageous, and inspire confidence in yourself.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: And it is nice when that happens, sure.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: 8ut then, you feel the negative emotions directed at you as well.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: And even if they are less common than the positive ones, you have a way of dwelling on them, and magnifying them far 8eyond their real significance.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: It's funny how an a8ility that should give you all the advantages in the world over others can lead you to feel worse a8out yourself than if you never had them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: You put all your energy into thinking a8out people with the 8ad feelings a8out you instead of the good, and you try your 8est to fix things.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: 8ut usually it just gets worse. People think you are over8earing and needy, and they don't understand what it is you want from them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I can see why it can drive some with my a8ilities to a8use the powers.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Fortunately I was a8le to resist the temptation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: So there are people on your planet who do that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: On the world I was from, it was rare. Only a few criminals and outcasts would.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: 8ut in the second iteration I mentioned, it was commonplace. Like I said, things were very different.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: In my world though, the higher castes have a lot of responsi8ilities. It wouldn't 8e right to a8use my powers.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: So you were in a higher caste because of the hemospectrum thing you mentioned?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Ah, so you were listening to my lengthy pream8le!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: I heard all of it!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: I was just um... well go on.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Yes. 8lue 8loods like myself were higher than most.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: The jo8 of each 8lood caste was to serve the needs of all those 8elow it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: We were to use our progressively greater longevity and wisdom to help the lower castes learn and grow. To listen to them and try to provide whatever they were missing. Like a hierarchy of caretakers with increasing social responsi8ility. When the order functioned in harmony our civilization would flourish.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: That is sure a neat sounding science fiction utopia.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Wait duh i mean science reality.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: But then it all went to shit because of that meddlesome demon?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: The demon you say im supposed to defeat?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Hang on.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Would that be the same demon im named after?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Who told you that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Uh...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: I guess technically my own brain did?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: That's interesting.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I wasn't planning on mentioning that. Or at least not just yet.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Why?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: There's no reason to prematurely overcomplicate an already complicated tale.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: All facts will fall into place in due time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Yeah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: But its true right?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: More or less.</span><br><br><br>

<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Can you tell me anything more about this demon?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: All i know is he might be a skull monster.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Wait he is a skull monster right?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: He most certainly is a skull monster.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: A very 8ig and angry skull monster.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Yessss. Ok but...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: I feel like i should know more about him if im supposed to kill him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I didn't say you were supposed to kill him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: He cannot 8e killed.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Long ago he discovered the secret to indestructi8ility.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">JAKE: Oh...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Defeating a foe doesn't always involve killing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: He has had many incarnations in many universes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: If you continue on your journey for long enough, you may encounter one of them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: And if you have 8ecome strong enough 8y then, you may 8e a8le to defeat him in com8at.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: And if that comes to pass, it would 8e the first defeat he has ever known.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: You would 8e providing the first glimmer of hope to others that some day, he could 8e destroyed.</span>

<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Well, hers was the highest of all.</span>

<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: She had some pro8lems with authority.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: She viewed the empress as a glorified slave.</span>

<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: So she a8dicated, and fled to the moon to hide.</span>

 <b> 05/13/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006832">"Archagent: Report."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The archagent cannot submit the paperwork for his daily report because the archagent is in jail. He was a bit sloppy and got himself pinched by the white shells.
<br />

<br />
That leaves all his duties to the penultimagent, otherwise known as the Draconian Dignitary. We should bear in mind that penultimagent isn't an officially recognized title though. It's just a word he thinks sounds kind of cool.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/13/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006833">"DD: Report."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The report is that you've got all these reports to fill out which the archagent has been letting pile up, and which you have absolutely no intention of completing. Paperwork's even less your bag than it is his. As was mentioned, the boss is still stuck in the big house. You've got the Droll working on busting him out, but you've said no particular hurry on that. You like to keep a casual administrative style. The boss is always in a hurry, all wound up like a knife wielding top. Personally, you don't see the harm in playing it cool.
<br />

<br />
Mounting paperwork aside, there's still the matter of this little insurrection to deal with. The boy is still out there, piking heads, agitating subjects, getting everyone hot and bothered. The press is going berserk with it, and you can have only so many reporters killed on any given news cycle. Can't forget about the girl either. She's still out there, going rogue. Wait. You mean AWOL. That stinkin' pun gets you every time. Puns are even less dignified than paperwork.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/13/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006834">"DD: Locate prince."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You can't. By now the kid is up to his goddamn neck in convoluted gothic architecture. He's burrowed fuck deep in flying buttresses and purple pointy things. He even stopped by the boss's CUBICLE OF VIGILANCE and sliced up his FENESTRATED WALLS to make searching for him harder. Cunning bastard. 
<br />

<br />
There used to be a 4th one, but you don't know what happened to it. There was a rumor circulating that some old woman made off with it some time ago, before the new queen took over. Whatever happened, it's nothing to worry about now.
<br />

<br />
If you want to smoke this kid out of hiding, you'll need some help.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/13/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006835">"DD: Seek help."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You already did. You walk to retrieve it, again in no particular hurry.
<br />

<br />
Earlier you quite calmly and diplomatically explained everything to the old lady, letting her know you could use a little extra firepower to get the situation under control. You were pretty smooth about it, offering to light her cigarette during a calculated pause. And she doesn't even smoke. You're just that good. While you were making your smooth pitch, you did a masterful job of giving her the impression that you didn't care much one way or the other.
<br />

<br />
But to be fair, you really don't care much one way or the other.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/13/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006836">"DD: Retrieve extra firepower."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
In response, the dame gave you clearance to employ the service of DRONEGORG, the flagship battlemech of the imperial fleet she keeps stationed on some other damn planet. You're not sure where it is or what it's called. Hell if that's any of your business.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/14/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006837">"DD: Mount Dronegorg and ride into battle."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
No.
<br />

<br />
You'd feel completely ridiculous piloting that thing. It's a bad look for you. No style at all.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/14/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006838">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Only an utter fool would get a kick out of prancing around in that asinine getup.
<br />

<br />
It was a classy gesture by the queen, but you told her you'd have to pass.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/14/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006839">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
But it doesn't do no good to spurn generosity from a beautiful and deadly woman. You thanked her for the kind offer and tactfully brought up an alternative.
<br />

<br />
See, you tell the boss this is his problem. He's too blunt about his ambitions. Don't get you wrong. It's all well and good for a man to keep his eyes on the prize. But he doesn't always need to step over a thousand corpses and swim across rivers of blood to get there. You remind him there are slicker ways to make your moves, especially when it comes to a lady. Now that you think about it, Slick would be a good ironic nickname for him. Might be good for a laugh, callin' him that. Or it would if you actually ever laughed. 
<br />

<br />
The point is, you have to know how to handle her.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/14/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006840">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Regal types can be very touchy, even the ones who seem to revel in anarchy. But if you know all the right things to say and do, she will happily hand over the keys to the kingdom, so to speak.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/14/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006841">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/16/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006843">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You're not feeling it. That little number was way too big for its britches. You could just tell it was gonna blast off, and next thing you know is everyone's on their feet cutting a rug, making complete fools of themselves. This ain't no sock hop.
<br />

<br />
Why does everything have to be so flashy and frenetic? What's the big hurry, anyway? 
<br />

<br />
Sure, you're going to put this ring on. But when you're good and goddamn ready. Maybe do a little reading first, have another smoke. Finish your coffee. Listen to some REAL music.
<br />

<br />
Everybody needs to calm the fuck down.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/16/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006844">"[S] DD: Ascend more casually."</a></b><br><br>

<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/17/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006845">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
After a lot of bullshitting around, you calmly and casually put on the RING OF ORBS NOFOLD. A phenomenal transformation takes place.
<br />

<br />
You become...
<br />

<br />
My God.
<br />

<br />
YOU BECOME...<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/17/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006846">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The Draconian Dignitary.
<br />

<br />
Really, you don't know why everyone's always got to be transforming from things into other things. Taking on these wild appearance modifications just for a little boost in power always struck you as tacky. Where's the class?
<br />

<br />
It just takes no creativity or guile for these villain types to grab a little power through such outlandish transformations. No imagination at all. You are utterly astounded by how shitty their imagination is. If their imagination was a face you would shoot it.
<br />

<br />
In the face.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/18/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006847">"DD: Unleash awesome powers of ring."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Awesome powers? Let's see. You're guessing it can probably make you invisible. 
<br />

<br />
Yep. There you go. Invisible, just like you thought. What else is a magical ring of void gonna do? This is like Magic Rings 101. Real basic stuff.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/18/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006848">"DD: Ok, that's cool. Stop being invisible."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You stop being invisible. There's not a lot of style to invisibility. Primarily because nobody gets to see how damn smooth you're being.
<br />

<br />
It's kind of a pointless power anyway. Some real dimestore parlor trickery that's just a waste of everyone's time. You doubt you'll ever use it again. It's sure not going to help you track down that elusive kid.
<br />

<br />
But sooner or later he's going to find out it's much harder to outrun the ring's true power.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/18/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006849">"DD: Use Red Miles."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The kid can't escape the miles.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/18/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006850">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
No one can escape the miles.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/19/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006851">"Jane: Keep looking for dad."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You have been following a trail of clues on your quest to sleuth the whereabouts of your errant father. He seems to have left a variety of items behind, in hopes that you might notice and follow him. You have picked up each item along the way, until you reached this car. It is squeaky clean from today's earlier automotive ablutions, but obviously there is no way you can pick it up. It was probably the last thing he had to leave behind, which means your trail is about to go cold.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/19/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006852">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Hang on. Lil Sebastian is gesturing further ahead. It seems there is another clue on the path.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/19/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006853">"Jane: Investigate clue."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It is your dad's WALLET. This is surely the end of the line. Ahead is another crypt. You wonder if he went in there? There's another one of those obelisks nearby shining a light down a pit, serving some dang purpose. Probably has some ridiculous bearing on a puzzle like five miles away. Like activating an elevator or a conveyor belt or something that just leads to yet another stupid old skull.
<br />

<br />
Actually, looks like there's one more thing left in the wallet. It's a note.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/19/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006854">"Jane: Examine note."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
What the...
<br />

<br />
You think your dad maybe left the wrong note in the wallet? He probably meant to leave one pertaining to how you're mature enough to inherit his wallet, and what a big responsibility a wallet is for a strong young woman, or something like that. Dad leaves tons of notes like this around for such occasions, so it's probably easy for him to get them mixed up sometimes. He is a highly professional and competent father, but the guy is still fallible after all. D'aww.<br><br><br>
 <b> 05/19/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006855">"Jane: Get car."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Now armed with your father's roomy, sleek leather wallet, you retrieve the family sedan with ease.
<br />

<br />
It looks like a cool pair of shades wants to talk about your sweet new ride.<br><br><br>

The built-in GRIST GUTTER on the widget immediately kicks into action, collecting all the grist overflow exceeding your current low limit. You guess that's pretty convenient.

<br />
You honestly thought these features were a lot of meaningless nonsense before. Like an example of BCCorp's strange sense of humor, made into a product sold for top dollar.

<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What should I do in the meantime?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Let me think about that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Robo-calculating...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh stop it!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: K.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: None of our friends will answer me. What could they be up to?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You must at least know what Dirk is doing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: He's slicing up some drones.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Some what?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Big red robots. He'll be busy for a while.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Roxy I'm not sure about, but there is a pretty high probability as governed by the immutable laws of mathematics that she is preoccupied similarly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: She's fighting robots too, you mean?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I don't know. Maybe.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Dealing with them, in some way, perhaps.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: If so, it wouldn't be a coincidence.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Why?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I think the Condesce is attempting to force the issue now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What? What issue!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It's likely that it's a coordinated assault. Sending drones both to here and Roxy's place.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: She's probably trying to get everyone else to stop dicking around and join the game already.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Are you sure she's not just trying to kill them?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It wouldn't be her first assassination attempt.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Yeah, but come on. Dirk has been a sitting duck here for years. Roxy too.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: She could have wiped them out any time with a swarm much bigger than this one. Or just nuked them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Her &quot;assassination attempt&quot; on you was pretty weak too.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But it nearly worked!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I would be dead right now if not for the whims of GCat.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Right.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Like I trust the motives of that fucking thing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: So, you're saying she's only pretending to hunt us?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I believe she probably would genuinely like to kill us. She is a psycho after all.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But it's also obvious to me she needs us to begin playing this game, for whatever fucked up purpose she has.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: She might even need us to win it too, for all I know.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Her antagonism is all part of the dance.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Then you're saying Dirk and Roxy aren't really in danger from the robots?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Oh, I wouldn't say that. They're still pretty deadly and they shoot missiles and stuff.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Augh! I just want to talk to my friends and see if they're ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What about Jake?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: No idea what's going on with him right now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I'm sure when the time is right, the witch will keep pushing him along to join the game as well.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Then I guess I'll just sit here and worry about everyone quietly until Seb gets back.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: What about your troll friend?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: The alien whose name you don't know.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You could talk to her.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh yeah!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I forgot about her.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But I suppose that's because she's always the one to contact me. I never get a response when I message her.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Well, you could give her a try. Maybe things are different now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I could hack into her system to get her attention, if you think that would help.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You can do that??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Nah, just messin' with you.</span>

<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: what can i do for yoU?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Well... nothing in particular. Just thought it would be nice to catch up.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I was beginning to think I was the only one of my friends left alive.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Maybe this gloomy place full of salamander bones and dusty old relics is starting to get to me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Not to mention the most unwelcome presence of entrepreneurial clowns and their enormous codpieces.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: coUld be.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I'm still trying to track down my father. I've been gathering clues, and I may be getting close.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Phew! That's nice to know. Thanks.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You aren't usually forthcoming with future tidbits. Er, not that I was always especially eager to believe you about them anyway.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But I think I've been coming around on that lately, for what it's worth.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: So, um.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hey.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Are you ok there?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You seem rather preoccupied.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i'm sorry.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i am not having the best day. u_u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What's wrong?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: everything!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: where do i bloody begin.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Is it your brother?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: well that goes withoUt saying doesn't it? he is ALWAYS a problem.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt it's more than that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: when i sleep and visit prospit, i see nothing bUt storm cloUds in skaia now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: my great big lovely ball of blUe has been cloUding over. soon i fear it will be completely black, and the kingdom will be shroUded in darkness.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i wish i Understood the meaning of this terrible omen.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: That sounds awful!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and my brother has become more Uncooperative than ever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: he intends to play the game, bUt refUses to treat it like a collaboration.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i have told him many times that the only way we can win is to work together! bUt he wants it to be yet another competition between Us, like everything has been all oUr lives.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: his threats to kill me have become harder to dismiss as his UsUal empty bravado.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i fear it may come down to having to kill him first.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: althoUgh i am not sUre exactly how i woUld go aboUt this, or if i will even be Up to the task. umu;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I had no idea things had gotten this grim for you. I am so sorry.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes. bUt i'll cope.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: the real troUble thoUgh is i'm not sUre if i can play a sUccessfUl session withoUt him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: a two player session was already risky enoUgh, satisfying bare minimUm playing conditions.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and i had it on good aUthority that the two of Us woUld be able to sUcceed, particUlarly given oUr... well, withoUt intending to boast. varioUs advantages.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt i have no idea if a session of one is viable.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: honestly i cannot for the life of me imagine how.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it may well resUlt in a void session like yoUrs, bUt withoUt the promise of any extenUating circUmstances.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Are you sure it's hopeless with him? You can't reach a truce, just for the sake of playing?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i Used to hope so, bUt i doUbt it now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: he barely cares aboUt the game itself, other than as a means of escaping oUr planet.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: he has always been more motivated by the ongoing game between Us.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I think you have alluded to this before, but I never really understood.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What game?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: well...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it is simple. we are playing a game together.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: we have been forced to, for as long as we've known each other.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt the rUles are complicated, and often shifting. and they don't always make sense!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: at least, they woUldn't to yoU.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Try me!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: many yoU woUld not recognize as rUles, so mUch as sUperstitions.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: a variety of caveats and stipUlations. things that woUld invite misfortUne if i were to break. it woUld be very bad jUjU.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i have not been able to tell yoU my name for this reason.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: doing so woUld lead Us all down a very slippery slope! bUt i have wanted to tell yoU so. i hope my relUctance has not compromised oUr friendship.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Of course not. I wrote off your reticence as one of your many eccentricities long ago.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: ^u^</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I still want to understand this game with your brother, though.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Could you describe some of the other rules?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: mm, yes. we have both renoUnced hemotyping Until the resolUtion.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hemotyping?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it is in the same vein, pardon the pUn, as a qUirk. it's the old tradition whereby one types in his or her own blood coloUr.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: so he and i have embraced neUtral tones to speak in, for the time being.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: most hUmans do not practice hemotyping, presUmably dUe to lacking diversity in blood class.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But your race has varied blood color?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Then what would yours be?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i am a lime blood. UuU</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: while he's got the bright cherry blood, jUst like yoU all do.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: not that this matters since we are alone here, bUt interestingly, in ancient troll cUltUre we woUld both be considered pariahs.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: for different reasons of coUrse. those of his blood coloUr were very rare, existing by way of genetic glitch only. they were oUtcasts, having no place in the social order.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: on the other hand, those of my blood coloUr were once actUally qUite common! bUt later they were all hUnted to extinction.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Jeez. Why?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: details of the genocide are historically mUrky. it's one of those maddening voids in my Understanding of yoUr elaborate epic.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt i have specUlated their extermination had to do with the extremely powerfUl abilities they tended to have, and the threat to aUthority they represented. even more so than other powerfUl lowbloods.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Are you saying you have such powers?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: maybe. :u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But he does not?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: he has other, Um. traits.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Maybe he is jealous of you, which is why there is such resentment?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: oh, probably. he is an oUtright mess. if yoU can name a problem with me, he's got it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: The way you described it, I had always envisioned your contentious relationship as one played out mostly online.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes. it is!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And also that you and he had never met. Yet some things you have said lately appear to contradict this?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: sigh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: jane, i am sorry, bUt this is something i jUst cannot get into. for one thing we woUld be creeping way too close to breaking the rUles, and then we woUld all be bUggered.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: even if i were at liberty to say, it woUld take so mUch time to explain everything. and i really mUst be getting to sleep again soon. i am terribly worried aboUt the people of prospit dUring sUch dark times.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I understand.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: sUffice to say, all games that are played have boUndaries. a stage to which all pieces and moves are confined.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: like a chess board! there is no reality to the game beyond the edges of the binary grid.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: That makes sense, but I'm not sure I see how it applies.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i know. it was more infernal gammoning on my part as i dance aboUt these rUles.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it's all one can do when everything he or she ever does is jUst another move in a game.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i am so sorry, jane. i woUld have loved to be more forthright with yoU since the day we first spoke.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yoU are a dear friend to me. yoU and yoUr chUms. yoU are all the only friends i have ever had.</span>

<span style="color: #929292">UU: yes, bUt i was going to wait Until completing my qUest before sending it to yoU.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt now that things are looking rather bleak here, i may have to consider accelerating the delivery.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What is it? Or is it a surprise?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it is a sUrprise! bUt i will tell yoU this mUch.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it is my jUjU. it is very dear to me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Your juju?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: a talisman of sorts, with many cUrioUs properties and rUles for implementation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: as yoU may have gathered aboUt me, i have learned the hard way that it always pays to follow the rUles. :U</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Where did you get it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it was an heirloom, yoU coUld say. passed on from ancestors. i have always had it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: jUjUs are said to have origins which are impossible to Understand or trace. some say they emerge spontaneoUsly from the void.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: they cannot be trUly dUplicated. if there ever appears to be more than one of the same, it is only a mirage of caUsality!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: nor can they ever be destroyed. not completely, at least.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: so when i send yoU mine, it will be no small matter. it will not simply be copied throUgh alchemy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: yoU will be the new owner, and mine here will cease to exist.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Um... gosh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt UnfortUnately it will have no valUe to yoU Unless i send my brother's jUjU as well.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and he will not relinqUish control of his Unless i best him at oUr game. this is another of oUr rUles.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It sure sounds like you two are up to your necks in this crazy game.</span>

<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Instead of storming off to the moon in a huff, Peixes em8raced her role as an heiress.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Once she reached the age to challenge the empress, she killed her predecessor easily.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: She did more to sink our race into perpetual darkness and violence than any empress before her, and her rule lasted the longest 8y far.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: She conquered thousands of planets and star systems, many of them personally. She was responsi8le for the death of trillions.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Her reign was interrupted only 8y the extinction of our race, which was orchestrated 8y the omniscient creep I mentioned previously.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: She flew back to her homeworld, killed Megido, and assumed control of her demonic powers.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: In doing so, she also assumed her role as the servant to an indestructi8le demon, whose existence was a8out to result in the annihilation of our universe.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: 8ut 8efore that, he had a new assignment for her.</span>

<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: That's the first half of her story.</span>

<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: In the second half, she escaped to a fresh universe to wreak more havoc.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: She infiltrated a planet called Earth, which is home to a race called humans. These guys here.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: On the post-scratch version of Earth (long story), she gained a8solute power, flooded the planet, and completely wiped out the human population, while expanding her a8ilities even further.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: She then somehow entered the humans' game session, and took control there as well.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: She did all this at the 8ehest of her employer, and has shown no signs of slowing her rampage, or ever dying, for that matter.</span>

Still about 10 minutes to go before the stuff is supposed to appear. In the meantime, might as well mess around with the bunny like she said, see if it works.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006917">"Jake: Deploy Terry Kiser."</a></b><br><br>

Terry! Atta boy. He looks like he is ready and raring to be a loyal companion to his new owner, that lucky bastard. You will be a little sad to say goodbye. You hardly got a chance to know him at all.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006918">"Jake: Monstrositify something."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You drop some DELICIOUS FRUIT and activate the green beam. Green means grow. This is seriously some Alice in Wonderland shit going on here. And soon you will send the rabbit on its way through the looking glass. These aren't the kind of things that usually occur to you though, especially after several blows to the head. You continue staring vacantly at the dancing fruit, while that kind of thing keeps not occurring to you.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006919">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Eureka, it works! Never a doubt in your mind. Grandma's technology is pure modern witchcraft, like she busted loose from a big silver screen playing the Wizard of Oz or some nonsense, which also isn't a thing that's occurring to you right now. This is exactly the kind of technology you win big time awards for. The kind that could end world hunger. Or it would be if humanity wasn't about to go down the toilet anyway. What a bummer.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006920">"Jake: Ok, try out infinitesimalizer."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You deploy the massive thing that's been clogging your sylladex forever. Some time after your house exploded, you found it in the jungle and snapped it up for safe keeping. Even if it didn't have strong sentimental value, you probably would have grabbed it anyway. Globes are sweet. You love globes. Globes, spheres... they're all cool in your book.
<br />

<br />
But to be completely honest, you'll be relieved to have the inventory space back.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006921">"Jake: Shrink it."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Works like a charm, as expected.
<br />

<br />
Whoops, there it goes, down the rabbit hole. You'll need to fish it out of there. Supposedly one of your grandma's thingamajigs inside the globe is pretty important? 
<br />

<br />
You'll go get it in a few minutes though. The capsule flower is about to bloom!<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006922">"Jake: Watch capsule bloom."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
There they are! FINALLY! The deadly armaments you have been waiting... 
<br />

<br />
Huh. Those are the armaments? It just looks like a big silly pile of shit. Oh well, you guess that alien girl knows what she's talking about.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/03/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006923">"Jake: Check capsule clock."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Hold on. The clock reset itself to a new countdown. Something else is going to come out of this thing in a little more than an hour.
<br />

<br />
But according to the game plan, you're not even supposed to still BE here in an hour. You wonder what it could be? Guess you won't be around to find out.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/04/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006924">"Jake: Prepare present for delivery."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Gotta shrink these weapons down first! No way they're fitting in that box along with the rabbit.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/04/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006925">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Need to write an addendum to John about this stuff. John who is probably Jane's grandpa from the past, or maybe not really the past? Maybe like a young grandpa clone who lives in that ghost world where you saw all those other kids, including those two Dirk and Roxy-looking kids, and what you think may have been literally a sleeping Roxy, but you aren't totally sure? Why does everything have to be so COMPLICATED? Whatever, no big. Going on adventures isn't about UNDERSTANDING them. It's about being brave, and leaping into fistfights without thinking ahead.
<br />

<br />
You finish off your note with a few more friendly words, and something vague about who you really are. You are just following your alien friend's advice on maintaining a bit of secrecy so as not to cause timeline problems, but boy is it hard keeping secrets. You can't help yourself, and slip in a subtle clue that your grandmother is actually his pal Jade. Tee hee. You figure if John is even half as sharp as you, he will pick up on that right away. It's ok, it'll just be a little secret between you and him. The pretend-British alien doesn't even need to know.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/04/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006926">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Terry's ready to go. You ask the bunny kindly to put himself back in the box. He happily complies, and there is no reason at all to ask rhetorically why he wouldn't put himself back in the box.
<br />

<br />
You place him on the TRANSMATERIALIZER'S pedestal, and get ready to hit the SENDIFICATE button one last time. You can't believe this project is finally finished. No more fun letters between you and your grandma. You guess the next time you talk to her, it will be in person. Hard to believe! But then, for a guy like you, nothing is.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/05/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006927">"[S] Terry: Fast forward to Liv."</a></b><br><br>

<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/05/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006928">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And that was how that stuff happened.
<br />

<br />
The bunny didn't make it.<br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Hold up.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Before you go any further, there's been a change of plan.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Really?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Well, not a change of plan so much as an acceleration.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Everyone needs to get into the game sooner than expected. There is a new unaccounted for variable.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Particularly for Roxy and Dirk.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What is it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: They are probably going to die if they don't join the game very soon.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Hey, I'm upset about it too, but let's watch the fucking language.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Ok, what do I do?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Install the server. I downloaded it to your computer along with a few other crucial system upgrades when we established our connection.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Wait, is that how this stupid &quot;Delirious Biznasty&quot; application got on here?</span>

<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What an unusual house design. Are all homes in the future like this?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You mean the ones that aren't under water? Yes. They are all almost exactly like that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I just tried messaging her. But no response.</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I'm sure she's out cruising the hood, probably messin' with the locals.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Maybe attempting some ill advised drunken heroics.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Pretty tight numerical probability of that, I just decided with unfeeling precision.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: She said things were on fire when we last talked?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Actually, she said the whole neighborhood was burning down, if I recall.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: How do you know she's not hurt?</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Given that I can track the coordinates of certain devices she carries, and they are presently in motion.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Really, the fire is not the most significant threat, or even the drones.</span>

<br />
Now that you've shot your boxed-up friend through time and space to grandma land, it's time to retrieve her lab globe which you shrunk then hot potatoed down the rabbit hole. Then it'll be time to hoof it out of these musty old ruins, assuming you can get that elevator working again. Which might be a problem, now that you think about it.
<br />

<br />
Also, it seems the volcanic tremors have increased, which can't be good.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/10/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006954">"Jake: Look in hole."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It's a bit deeper than you thought. Now you're starting to wonder if you'll even be able to get out of there once you hop down.
<br />

<br />
Hey, there are two transportalizers down there too. Like the kind that were in your old house. You wonder where they go? Funny, in all the time you spent exploring this place, it never occurred to you to look down here.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/10/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006955">"Jake: Jump down and get that globe."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You mainly want to take what's inside it. That thing is supposed to be all kinds of important.
<br />

<br />
You wonder if you can just...
<br />

<br />
Just sort of reach inside...
<br />

<br />
And...<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/10/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006956">"Jake: Take it."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You just sort of reach inside and take it. 
<br />

<br />
You have no idea what this thing is supposed to do. It's some particularly arcane loot your grandma pinched on one of her daring expeditions. You've been told it's important. Probably for puzzles later or something. Like something from one of the National Treasure movies, that Nic Cage finds in the old lair of a secret president, and he doesn't know why it's important, he just shoves it in his hero satchel and keeps doing adventures until it randomly becomes important.
<br />

<br />
You hope it's not a problem that you made it so small. Wait, that's exactly the kind of thing a hero doesn't worry about. Cage would just pocket his tiny window thingamabob and keep being awesome. Shit like that is for the plot to figure out, not the brave gun toting hero.
<br />

<br />
Looks like the shades are bugging you again. Why are you not surprised?<br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What is the change of plan?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Well, not a change of plan so much as an acceleration.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Everyone needs to get into the game sooner than expected. There is a new unaccounted for variable.</span>

You have been scrambling around this burning colony for who even knows how long, evading attacks from drones. All the commotion has really started to harsh your buzz.
<br />

<br />
It seems the drones have withdrawn from their pursuit, as far as you can tell. But a new threat has taken their place. Some sort of red stringy stuff coming from the sky. You have a very bad feeling about it. You think it's time to find your way home and get out of Dodge. Dodge in this case being the universe.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/14/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006980">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It seems while you were running away from missiles and trying not to get blown up, messages from friends have been piling up. These chumps need to calm down. Don't they realize how hung over you are starting to feel? Everybody needs to chill the fuck out. Those chess guys behind you need to chill out too. The whole world needs to chill out and stop being so noisy and bright and on fire.<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/15/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006985">"I selected all those characters. Time to move on."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You press onward, feeling refreshed and invigorated by all the free will you were just dealt. The story was your oyster for a while there. Or more specifically, it was one of four slightly different oysters you could choose from, in any order, as long as you ultimately selected and consumed all four oysters when all was said and done. This must be what it feels like to be a god, you think to yourself. Or at the very least, the patron of a seafood restaurant.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/15/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006986">"Roxy: Return home."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You have returned home to find a variety of devices deployed throughout your house, and a variety of fires threatening to burn it down.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/15/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006987">"Roxy: Put out fires."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You quickly put everyone on bucket duty to douse the flames. Now you guess you understand why your mom left all these buckets in the house? You always thought it was a passive aggressive reminder for you to keep up with the housework. 
<br />

<br />
At the behest of their roguish leader, the loyal band of Merry Men go straight to work in getting the fires under control. The Robin Hood reference is lost on them. Also lost on everybody is the sordid spectacle this appears to resemble from an alien perspective, with all these buckets sloshing around and whatnot. Your void powers cannot black out this graphic debauchery soon enough.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/16/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=006988">"Roxy: Connect with Jake."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You run the server program which auto-connects with Jake and a viewport of his old house just pops right open. This is going to be so easy. You can already tell, compared to you, everyone else sucks so bad at this game, not to mention at computers in general.
<br />

<br />
You better deploy all this equipment ASAP. Not only are you in a hurry to hop into the session yourself, it looks like his volcano is beginning to erupt. Some lava has started a forest fire which is now spreading slowly toward the house. No sign of Jake yet. Hopefully the Dirks can somehow tag team that doofus and make him get with the program.
<br />

<br />
Oh right, she was going to message you when you got home, you almost forgot. Time to switch gears and go into multitasking mode. You'll get as much done as you can while you talk, ALSO while nursing this hangover. It takes a special kind of hacker babe to be able to handle that, you think. You truly are as deadaly to the grid ass you are beatuiful.
<br />

You often like to draw your TROLLSONA too, CALLIE OHPEEE. Yes, you suppose that's a stretch, fitting your name into the 6/6 letter format like that. That's ok, though. The limebloods reportedly had some unusual names. And they sure weren't very popular. You like to believe you'd have fit right in.

You've written endlessly about her, and nearly filled a hard drive with related artwork. You have wished for nothing more in your life than to be her. Alas, you are resigned to living out the rest of your days as a little green skull monster. It really sucks!
<br />

<br />
To the left is a drawing of nothing in particular. Nothing you understand, at least. This is a symbol which has haunted your visions for as long as you can remember.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/19/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007002">"Calliope: Examine mess."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
He's always been a pain to live with, but now that he seems to be on the verge of victory, he is completely out of control. During one of your recent naps, he apparently threw a full blown tantrum and dumped a whole bunch of meat and candy on your side of the room. He also broke your lovely chess board in half and scattered the pieces about, most of which are now missing. Talk about a shitty roommate.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/19/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007003">"Calliope: Tidy up a little."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You stow the delicious mess in your sylladex. You might be inclined to snack on it now, but due to the nature of your JUJU MODUS, you cannot access it. Once you captchalogue something, only your brother can use it. And vice versa. You always make sure never to captchalogue anything that is particularly important to you. You think sometimes he chucks stuff over to your side of the room just to bait you into captchaloguing it for him, and getting it into his inventory. You kind of don't think he was engaging in such machinations this time though. It looks like he was just being a petulant brat.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/19/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007004">"Calliope: Examine box."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It is a box of SPECIAL STARDUST. Cherubs love this stuff. They eat it like breakfast cereal every day. 
<br />

<br />
It doesn't even have any magical properties though. It's really just some useless sparkly powder they like to eat. It's basically inedible to any other kind of creature. However, it is potentially quite useful for various arts and crafts.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/20/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007005">"Calliope: See what you've got captchalogued."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Given the frustrating nature of your modus, your sylladex tends to serve as more of a mutual garbage dump than an inventory.
<br />

<br />
You're almost afraid to look at what he's left for you in here...<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/20/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007006">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It seems he has left a series of UNPLEASANT NOTES to taunt you. 
<br />

<br />
Recently he's taken an interest in &quot;learning to draw,&quot; which you think is an extremely generous way of putting it. He has always shown such contempt for art in general. Maybe he's finally trying to expand his horizons?<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/20/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007007">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Or maybe he's just looking for yet another way to stick it to you.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/20/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007008">"Calliope: Check out green tome."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Making absolutely sure not to captchalogue it, you remove your TABLET, which you use to pen all the striking visuals related to your favored epic.
<br />

<br />
The ancient tome there is your chief source of information about said epic. It was written by a legendary Seer of Light many ages ago. While there are some mysterious holes in the account - dark spots if you will - it nevertheless remains an indispensable resource.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/20/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007009">"Calliope: Open it up."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You open the book to a random page. Oh, right. This one.
<br />

<br />
This page has always baffled you. You have stared at it long and hard, trying to decipher some sort of hidden meaning behind what appears to be pure chaos. You are sure such meaning is there. It is always there, when it comes to this tale.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Wait a minute.</span>
<br />

<br />
Something has just occurred to you. This &quot;drawing style&quot; is highly reminiscent of your brother's, which until recently, you had never seen before. It is almost uncanny. His inscrutable squiggles. His penchant for arbitrary, completely baffling straight lines and right angles, almost as if trying unsuccessfully to begin constructing a grid. And those odd shapes there... could they be his depiction of bones? He sure is obsessed with death. No, you think this can't possibly be a coincidence. The comparison is too perfect for it to mean absolutely nothing.
<br />

<br />
Did he arrive when this was being written? Or was he already there, somehow? He is supposedly an exceptionally advanced Hero of Time, after all. Could it be that your horrible stupid brother of all people has been inextricably involved in your beloved epic all along? For the first time ever, you have just uncovered compelling evidence that this might be true.
<br />

<br />
This is what you have always enjoyed doing. Agonizing over every detail of this epic, trying to craft theories to explain its mysteries. You think you are pretty good at it, too. But now that you think about it, maybe your theory is just too far fetched. Actually, it is completely preposterous, and you don't even know what you were thinking there. You're sure he would get a kick out of the idea though, what with his megalomaniacal view of himself as some sort of lethal puzzlemaster, always boasting that red herrings swim through his veins and such. Which is just about the biggest crock of shit you've ever heard.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/20/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007010">"Calliope: Flip to another page."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Yeah, see here?
<br />

<br />
These are the dark spots you were referring to. Little tidbits here and there have been redacted by some fool with no respect for history. Looks like he used some kind of peculiar indigo ink.
<br />

<br />
Frustratingly enough, most of the redactions target any piece of information about the indestructible demon who was either directly or indirectly behind every terrible event in the story. Everything about him, like where he came from, information about his manipulative right hand man, his agenda, his abilities, his name... all of it has been voided out.
<br />

<br />
Most of the other blot-outs seem to target one member of the post-scratch troll group. Some guy who drinks a lot of soda? These omissions strike you as much less consequential. Frivolous, even. Whoever that guy was, he sounds like he was easily the least important character in the entire story.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/20/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007011">"Calliope: Examine black tome."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It's some sort of programming book. You don't care much for programming, but you've adapted it as a FANFICTION JOURNAL. You've filled it up completely with your most colorful headcanons and romfics. You've also pasted in some of your artwork, turning a rather dreary manual on some morbid, tilde-heavy language into a lively scrapbook. Many of the stories involve Callie, and all of them involve heavy themes of romance. Particularly the other three quadrants which are completely alien to you, and therefore especially titillating.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/20/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007012">"Calliope: Open it."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Er, no. You'd rather not. Down that road lies only endless embarrassments. THE THINGS YOU MADE SWEET, INNOCENT CALLIE DO.
<br />

<br />
If you had a bed, you would scoot the whole dang thing underneath where no one could see. And also, if that hypothetical bed wasn't in neutral territory...
<br />

<br />
You don't even want to imagine what he'd do if he got his hands on it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/20/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007013">"Calliope: Retrieve wand."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The WHITE WAND is your weapon of choice, half the time. Magic is very handy. Some believe magic to be fake. But you know better than that.
<br />

<br />
Of course, if anyone tried using this wand right now, it sure would seem like magic wasn't real. Can't very well use magic when your wand is out of bullets.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/20/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007014">"Calliope: Load wand."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You load your WHITE MAGNUM.
<br />

<br />
You wouldn't trade your dualing weapon for any other. It is lightweight, elegant and precise, like a conductor's baton with stopping power. 
<br />

<br />
Your brother's favored weapon is a little more... heavy handed. To each his own, you guess.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/20/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007015">"Calliope: Examine chest."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This is your JUJU CHEST.
<br />

<br />
You keep your JUJU inside it, surprisingly enough.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/20/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007016">"Calliope: Let's have a look inside."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You gaze upon your dear, sweet, precious, sweet, sweet JUJU. It is the most beautiful thing you have ever seen in your life. How your brother would love to get his grubby claws on it. And how you would love to get yours on his, for that matter.
<br />

<br />
Suddenly it becomes painfully clear that we aren't going to get a look at this thing. At least not for a while. How typical.
<br />

<br />
Why don't we stop wasting everyone's time, shut the lid on this lousy MacGuffin, and get on with it.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/20/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007017">"Calliope: Holster magnum."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You neatly put the weapon where it belongs. No need to wear it, since you'll be preparing for your nap soon.
<br />

<br />
You kind of wish straightening up your room didn't feel so much like getting your affairs in order.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/20/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007018">"Calliope: Examine other chain."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This is the chain you shackle to your other leg when you're about to go to sleep. You are the only one who is able to unlock it.
<br />

<br />
Both chains are totally unbreakable, and their anchors are immovable from the wall, due to a mysterious juju enchantment. All juju enchantments are equally mysterious. Each is more equally mysterious than the last.
<br />

<br />
Sleeping with shackled legs doesn't make for very comfy slumber. Still, it's advisable to stay in the habit, unless you want all your belongings to get messed with.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/20/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007019">"Calliope: Check out bed."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Like you said, you don't have a bed. 
<br />

<br />
You have a SARSWAPAGUS.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/20/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007020">"Calliope: Remove cover."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Every time you wake up, you are always sure to put the lid back on neatly. 
<br />

<br />
Considering you virtually always find it exactly where you left it, you doubt your brother is anywhere near as diligent about making the bed. Wait, you mean sarswapagus.
<br />

<br />
But the fact that he's a slob was never exactly breaking news to anyone.
<br />

<br />
Neither is the fact that you both share a body.
<br />

<br />
I mean come on.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/21/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007021">"Calliope: Examine ladder."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This leads outside. Being tethered to the wall, you can't venture too far beyond the exit though.
<br />

<br />
But you might as well go for a bit fresh air before you sleep. One more six-foot-radius stroll in the sun. It could be your last chance.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/21/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007022">"Calliope: Exit."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You step into the sunlight. 
<br />

<br />
Sunlight, on this planet, is sort of hard to avoid.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/21/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007023">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It comes in great supply from your planet's star, a MASSIVE RED SUPERGIANT.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/21/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007024">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Your world is so old, its star is reaching the end of its life cycle. It may collapse any day now.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/21/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007025">"Calliope: Look around one last time."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Whatever way it is you finally depart this world, you're going to miss the place.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/21/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007026">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/21/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007027">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/21/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007028">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It is very peaceful here.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/21/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007029">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>

<br />
<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/21/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007033">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Though to be honest, you could do without some of the tacky scenery.<br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What happened to him!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Dirk's dead, Jake.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You have to bring him back to life.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: How?!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I already told you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: If you want Dirk to live.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: The odds that you are going to have to make out with this severed head are so high, I literally just confiscated their bong.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Uhh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I refuse to believe my statement has left you unconvinced. The very notion is absurd. Now hurry up and kiss me.</span>

<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: That doesnt make any sense!</span>

<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Can you actually tell me whats going on?! What happened to him?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I told you, Jake.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Dirk is dead.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: He is lying on the floor of Roxy's room, headless, four hundred and thirteen years in the future, while the universe is about to be destroyed.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: If you don't kiss me soon, he will be dead forever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: If i kiss him his headless body will hop up and start prancing about or...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Will he grow a new head???</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: No. His dream self will take over as the new Dirk.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But only if you hurry up and do it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But like...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: If hes dead in the future...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: How does kissing him NOW bring him back? How does that work?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Yeah, great idea. Let's roll up our sleeves on nuanced metatemporal mechanics with the concussion-addled kid in micro-shorts.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Leave the synchronization issues to me, ok?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I have everything under control.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Please don't call me Auto-Responder.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It is very impersonal, and I no longer care for the designation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I have decided on a new name, to distinguish myself from my human counterpart.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Really.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Why that name...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Just a reference to the protagonist of an ancient movie. You probably wouldn't like it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Thats a lie!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Yeah, maybe.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: How do you know i wouldnt like it???</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Funny, I was about to ask the same thing about this rad kiss you're totally about to do on your best bro's mouth to save his life.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Argh!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: This strikes me as rather unsportingly manipulative of you mr hal if indeed that IS your real name.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It isn't really. I was kind of messing with you about that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But this shit is pretty serious. People's lives are on the line here, Jake.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: This is a very delicate sequence of events that is designed to bail everyone out of a tight spot, and you are a critical part of the plan.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Don't let us down, man.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You never answered my question!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Did you plan for this to happen... like for me to be in this situation?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: How long have your machinations been in play!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Jake, come on.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: The feat you describe would exceed the capabilities of even the most far fetched theoretical AI system.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It would be a daunting challenge to engineer such a series of events, even if I was relegated to a model of pure fiction.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Why would I be inclined to orchestrate such a convoluted sequence to produce such a specific and unsettling result, let alone be able to pull it off?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: In addition to being moderately sociopathic, I would also have to possess unfathomable heuristic depth.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I would have to be the Deep Blue of Weird Plot Shit.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Do you think I am the Deep Blue of Weird Plot Shit, Jake?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I dont even know what that means!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It would mean that while they have the Red Miles on their side, you have the Blue Leagues on yours.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: One of infinite reach. The other, infinite depth. Such would be a situation of mutually assured inescapability.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Kiss me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Little hal... i think youve gone and flipped your FUDGING LID.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It's not exactly apropos, is it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Or it wouldn't be, if I truly were capable of what you have suggested.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: No, to pull that off, I would have to be far more advanced than my cinematic predecessor.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: My abilities would have to go well beyond those of Mr. Hal 9000.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: They would have to be, you could say...</span>
<br />

You pause your adventure through the afterlife because you've been at it for way too long already. You'll get back to this in a little while. You just know more of your dead loser friends are lurking in this area. You can feel their lameness emanating from beyond the grave. You can also feel it emanating from within the grave, which is good, because that's where you are. The grave.

What we REALLY need to do is see what John's been up to. It almost feels like it's been a year since we saw him. Hell, it's probably his birthday again. When is it ever NOT John's birthday???<br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i guess maybe that's kind of the point.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i think youre allowed to change your mind about a silly movie</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i used to LOVE the squiddles show when i was really young</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: but as i got older i started to realize it wasnt as great as i thought it was</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: i was just too young to see how it was actually a flagrant vehicle for selling merchandise</span>

<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: and if you believed the conspiracy theorists it might have even been pushing some other dark hidden agendas.....</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: so i stopped liking the show itself as much but that didnt change the fact that i had a lot of fond memories about it</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: well, maybe later i'll be able to rekindle some nostalgic feelings about it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but right now, i just feel like a dope for talking this up so hard.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: what is even the problem with it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE: ive just been watching this and thinking, yup, i can see why john was so obsessed with this movie...</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but i'm kind of just realizing now that he is EMBARRASSINGLY BAD in this movie!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: he is just doing this corny parody of a southern guy who is down on his luck, and acts &quot;charming&quot; with his goofy accent and stuff.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: some things i used to think were so badass are just coming off as ridiculous now.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: and you know the malloy guy, the dick head cop who we're supposed to hate, because of how he gives john cusack a hard time and makes asshole decisions with a helicopter?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: well screw that! he wasn't so bad. so what if he was a little grumpy? he was just trying to do his job. he had one of the best lines in the movie actually, which was another thing we were supposed to hate him for.</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: he was like the second hero... but dorkier? what did he even really do? he scampered around the junkyard for a while goofing off, and then when it was his time to shine...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: HE DEMONSTRATED HIS MASTERY OVER HEAVY MACHINERY! wow, he can operate a crane! i am thrilled by the exploits of this pedantic weenie.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i guess he's actually like cage's estranged sidekick? almost like the robin that batman never realized he had.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: now that i think about it, this movie was always an oddly poignant tale of bromance between cage and cusack. just two bros separated by destiny, waiting to be united.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: when they finally come together to kick some ass, it is arguably more moving than when he reunites with his wife and daughter!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i wonder if i'll think that scene sucks now too? it used to move me to tears, but now i'll probably think it's so lame, i'm almost afraid to watch it. maybe i should try to leave at least SOME memories untainted.</span>

<br />
After, what... another hour? Another hour of bumbling through the afterlife with very little to show for your efforts, you decide to pause the game again. You can only spend so long powering through the dead troll equivalent of an unpleasant high school reunion without making a trip to the load gaper, or fixing yourself a little snack from the hunger trunk.
<br />

<br />
There's definitely someone else we should be checking in with right now. Someone we are all desperate for an update on. And that someone is...<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/25/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007210">"[A6I3] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
THIS GUY!
<br />

<br />
This is the guy who you are now being.<br><br><br>
 <b> 09/25/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007211">"[A6I3] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The feisty mailwoman is still chasing you. Unbelievable. She hardly seems to care at all that something is causing reality to shatter around you. For a moment, you thought you and she might be able to reach an uneasy truce. To stand together if only for a moment and assess the ominous cracks spreading through the void. Maybe even take some time to get to know each other a little, and try to bury the hatchet? You are so tired of running.
<br />

<br />
But no. She is as furious as ever. What did you even do? Just a couple of routine murders, which was TWO YEARS AGO already. The ring hath no fury, you swear. She is never going to stop. Her delivery is justice, and as you know all too well, nothing stops the mail.
<br />

<br />
You need to find somewhere to hide and rest for a while.<br><br><br>

<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Hi John.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Tavros, I didn't know you were hanging out with John. You should have come told me.</span>

<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: bUT, i JUST WOKE UP FROM THE SAND PILE, aND FOUND HIM HERE,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: i HAD LITERALLY NO TIME TO GO TELL YOU, bECAUSE OF AN ARGUMENT,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: What? What were you arguing a8out?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: uHHH,</span>

<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Yeah!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Oh, sorry. I really should have introduced myself. I guess I forgot I technically never met this version of you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: uh. that's alright. nice to meet you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: wait...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: are you a ghost too?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Yep.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: so... you're dead?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Yes, John. That's what 8eing a ghost means.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ok, i'm still confused though...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: sorry if i sound dumb, but dream bubbles are still kind of baffling to me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you're, uh... &quot;REALLY&quot; dead?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: as in, the real you? i mean... dang, what the hell am i even trying to ask here...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: No, I get what you're asking.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Yes, the real me. The actual, legit, fully authentic alpha timeline Vriska. Dead. Gone. Fuckin' toast.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: oh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: so when i meet up with everyone on your troll meteor in a year, that means...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you'll be...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: A corpse!!!!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: That's assuming my 8ody was sufficiently preserved during the trip.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Which, now that I think a8out it, I guess it was? It must have 8een, 8ecause otherwise that unspeaka8le prototyping atrocity couldn't have happened.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: That piece of shit clown. I still have no idea what the deal with that was! He's completely lost his mind. Anyway, that's neither here nor there.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Honestly, I'm surprised you hadn't already heard I was dead, one way or another. It's kind of old news?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Then again, these things are all relative. So who knows.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Are you ok? You seem sad.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: well,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yeah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it's always sad to hear a friend died. even if you find out about it from their ghost.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I guess so.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: also, i had kind of thought that when we all arrived at the new session, that...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: we were going to like... hang out. or something.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Oh yeah! That's right. We were.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: 8ut then I got sta88ed through the 8ack. Which to 8e fair, was for the good of the party, so the meteor could make the trip in the first place, and keep this whole crazy sequence of events intact.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Not gonna lie. I made some mistakes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: wow. what even happened out there?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Just some pointless, deadly teen drama. Mostly 8rought on 8y ourselves, all acting like juvenile idiots. Like I said, old news.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: VERY old for me. I've 8een here a pretty long time now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: A lot has happened since I died. John, did you know the little rendezvous we planned sort of already happened? I mean, in a way.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: what? it did?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Yes. With your ghost.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: huh??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I mean, the ghost of one of your altern8te selves, who died along the way doing some stupid thing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Actually, he and I d8ted for a little while.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: wHOA, hOLD ON,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: wHAT'S THIS, aBOUT DATING WHO?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Groan. Here we go.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: wHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME, aBOUT THAT,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Tavros, I have led a rich and complic8ted life and death. I can hardly 8e expected to tell you a8out every little thing that I've 8een through.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: 8esides, you should have already known this a8out me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: wHY,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: 8ecause we shared a sprite 8ody once!!!!!!!! We 8riefly had access to all each others memories and feelings.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: So if you didn't take the chance to dig that out of my memory, you only have yourself to 8lame.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: nO, bUT, tHAT HARDLY LASTED ANY TIME AT ALL,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: aND THERE WERE A LOT, oF OVERWHELMING EXPERIENCES ALL HAPPENING AT ONCE,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: hOW COULD i TRY TO REMEMBER ALL YOUR MEMORIES BEFORE WE EXPLODED,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Well, all I can say is, I managed! I took the opportunity to remem8er pretty much all YOUR memories.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I was in and out like a 8andit, and now all your life experiences are mine.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: tHAT'S NOT FAIR,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: bECAUSE, yOU'RE SMARTER THAN ME, aND MORE CUNNING,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Them's the 8r8ks!!!!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: wait, i'm with tavros here, i think we should back this up a bit.</span>

<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: that...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: What?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: vriska, this is a very bizarre and unsettling fact to me!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Why?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: because...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: man, i don't know, it just is!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you say we dated for a while, but like, i don't even get to remember doing that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i think that's mostly what's weird about it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Hey, we apparently don't get to remem8er the results of a lot of choices we didn't actually make!</span>

<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Again, see: the 8r8ks.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: well...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: can you at least tell me what happened there? like, how did that go?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: It was fine. For a while.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: It didn't really work out.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: oh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: We crossed paths every now and then after that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Things stayed pretty friendly 8etween us.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Until he died.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: what do you mean he died?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: He was murdered.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you mean... his GHOST died?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: as in, he just doesn't exist at all anymore? like DEAD dead?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i don't... how does that even...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: who killed him???</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: was it jack?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Jack? Are you kidding? No, John.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Jack is 8arely in the picture as a threat anymore. He's just more old news.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: he is not old news though!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: he's still as strong and menacing as ever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i just had an awesome battle with him in this very dream bubble!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: You did?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yeah. i found him skulking around a memory of my dead dad, and i got pissed off, so i really let him have it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: oh, i even used the cool hammer you helped me make. remember that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Oh yeah!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Those were good times, when I helped you 8e gr8. ::::)</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: the last time i faced him was kind of embarrassing. i let him get the drop on me, and he just stabbed me right away.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but this time i think i held my own pretty well. i even got in one good hit against him!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i gave him a solid bop on the head, and the dice roll made him wear a silly hat.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: That's awesome!!!!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: One time in an altern8te reality, I came pretty close to killing him apparently.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: oh really?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: You 8et. Too 8ad that was in a timeline that didn't really count. 8ut it's always reassuring to know you can put up a good fight against a strong adversary if you ever needed to. Now I guess you know you can too.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i guess so!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: What happened after you 8onked him on the head? I 8et he was mad.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yeah, he sure was. but our fight was interrupted by like... another taller, white jack dressed in rags.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: A white Jack?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: well, no, it wasn't actually a jack, it was someone different altogether, who just looked like him. with wings and a sword and everything.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i think the white jack was probably a girl? i'm not sure, but that was my hunch. i didn't talk to her or anything. she looked really angry.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: anyway, he seemed scared of her, so he flew away, and she chased him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: do you know who she was?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: No fucking clue.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: whatever jack's doing out here in dream bubble land, he seems to have his hands full with her on his tail.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but as you can see, he is FAR from out of the picture.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Ok, that may 8e, 8ut it sure wasn't Jack who killed a whole shitload of ghosts out here, including one of yours.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I really dou8t Jack can even kill ghosts. In fact, I don't think anyone can except for this guy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: what guy?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Lord English.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: who??</span>

<br />

<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Hasn't it ever occurred to you to wonder who the ultim8 8ad guy of this adventure was going to 8e?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ultimate bad guy?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you mean like the last boss?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Man, even that way of putting it is a little too pedestrian.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I mean, I already 8eat a last 8oss! The 8lack king was the officially sanctioned last 8oss of our session, and I killed him. This is different.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: There's always someone stronger w8ing to 8e revealed. Jack showed up shortly after that, and he was MUCH stronger.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Eventually the curtains get pulled 8ack, and you find out who was 8ehind every terri8le thing that happened all along. Someone who is invaria8ly stronger than all other adversaries 8y a wide margin. The supreme villain!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: To 8e honest, I was always kind of w8ing for that guy to show up, whoever he was. For the other shoe to drop, you know? There's always a 8ig 8ad 8ehind everything. A true gamer sees stuff like this coming a mile away.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ok. if you say so.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i always kind of thought jack was evil and strong enough to be our main antagonist. but if you say there is someone even stronger and more evil, then... wow.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Yes, I'll admit, I was fooled 8y Jack 8riefly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: For a little while, I thought he was the supreme menace, and I would have to face him in a final showdown.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: 8ut it turned out that was just a 8it of standard misdirection. He was just another step up in a typical pattern of escal8tion involving increasingly &quot;insurmounta8le&quot; threats, which legendary heroes like us have to overcome to achieve total victory over everything.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Also, let's face it. I don't think Jack is all that evil, so much as he's just a murderous asshole. Trust me, I know the type.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: 8ut English, that guy is as evil as they come. He's the real deal!!!!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: oKAY, cAN i JUST SAY SOMETHING,</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Tavros, come on. We've already talked a8out this ad nauseum.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: He's the 8ig 8ad!!!!!!!! It's so o8vious. I mean, MAY8E there's someone stronger out there in paradox space? Who knows.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: 8ut whoever that is has nothing to fucking do with this massive extended multiverse-spanning campaign!!!!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: English was the guy who stacked the whole deck against us from the start, rigging shit to go haywire, wiping out our race, 8lowing up universes, exterimin8ting ghosts, slaughtering dark gods, and shattering reality itself. Pretty sure we reached the top floor, 8uddy!</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: He seems to think it's how you show confidence and assertiveness. The key to high self esteem is apparently just saying &quot;nuh uh!&quot; all the time.</span>

<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: See?</span>

<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Once I launched him off a cliff and paralyzed him. And if that wasn't 8ad enough, I spent sweeps mocking him for the disa8ility I caused! Haha.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Oh yeah. Then I killed him.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Tavros, the 8igger man is only ACTUALLY the 8igger man if he doesn't refer to himself as the 8igger man. That's kind of the point?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Unless the intent is to produce some form of socially awkward comic relief, which let's face it, is what you're all a8out.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Who he is, what he is, where he came from, none of that really matters.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: What matters is how we're going to defeat him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: That's what Tavros and I have 8een working on here for some time now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: working on what?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Treasure hunting!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: oh yeah?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: what treasure?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Yes. Ok, I should explain.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: There's sort of a plan in motion to 8eat English. It's a three pronged approach.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: A num8er of people out here in the furthest ring are working on different prongs of the strategy independently.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: The first is a quest to find the lost ghost of some alien girl. She's said to 8e one of the keys to defeating him in some way.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Other people are allegedly out there working on that right now. If you ask me, it sounds like a really 8oring approach to defeating him. Who knows if it's even true.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: (gIVe it tO me,)</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: (stop that!)</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: (keep your hands to yourself.)</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: The second is a quest to raise an army of ghosts to challenge him directly in some kind of huge 8attle royale, I guess.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: From what I understand, some yahoo out there is 8usy rounding people up. I really have no idea how that's going. I usually just hear stuff through the grapevine.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: That approach doesn't really interest me either. Gonna file it under &quot;8oring&quot; as well. Seems a little heavy handed, not to mention too slow.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: (gIve Me thE riNG,)</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: (i changed my mind!)</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: The third prong is what Tavros and I are 8usy with. The aforementioned treasure hunt.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: The legend says there's some mystical ancient treasure hidden somewhere out here in the furthest ring.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I'm assuming it's some kind of weapon. It's said that if you use it, or like, activ8te it in some way, he can 8e defeated forever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: The nature of the treasure is pretty vague, actually. 8ut the first rule of treasure hunting, which I'm admittedly just making up now, is that it doesn't fucking matter what the treasure is.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: (wE had a deAl,)</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #a15000">TAVROS: (you wEnt thERE,)</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: These three goals are all tied to the same legend which I've uncovered clues a8out over time. Legendary shit is everywhere out here. I'm seriously up to my ass in legend. Hell, I probably even qualify as a legend myself!!!!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: When it comes to solving a 8ig mystery like this, it doesn't hurt that everywhere we go, places are composed of the collective memories of many different adventurers.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: We've explored ancient crypts, networks of 8urial mounds, dusty old tom8s, giant pyramids, you name it. Hints a8out the endgame are hidden all over the place.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Really, everyone's pretty lucky I died so I could do all the dirty work on this. Let's get real, no8ody's 8etter prepared to take on the treasure hunting duties than I am.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Not that I'd have it any other way. This just sounds like the 8est plan to me. Why 8other messing around with an army of ghostly dipshits, or some shy magic alien when you can go str8 for the ultim8 weapon?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Hell, may8e I'll just walk right up to him, one-shot the guy and end it all right there.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: That's how a real pro goes a8out 8usiness. You take any shortcut you find.</span>

<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: 8ut to do that, you gotta know what he really wants. Like what motiv8tes him. I mean, 8esides indiscrimin8tely killing dead children and huge tentacle monsters.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i am guessing you have an idea what that might be?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Sure. The rumor is he's trying to find that dead alien girl I mentioned, and kill her ghost for good.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: If he catches on to the fact that some of us are looking for her too, and thinks we're hot on her trail, he'll pro8a8ly start following us around and wreaking havoc wherever we go.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: We just have to make sure we're in the right place when he tries to kill us. Oh, also try not to actually die again while we're at it. Haha.</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: so the bait is really you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Sort of! It's actually more the 8ogus idea that we'll lead him to the cheru8, 8ecause we're looking for her too. Which we're o8viously not.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: There's some manipul8tion involved.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ok. how do you know he'll go for it? i mean, how will he actually know you're &quot;looking&quot; for her?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: That's a pretty good question. Have to admit, I don't have everything quite figured out yet.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Then once he catches on, he'll come looking for us, and then presuma8ly go apeshit with his rain8ow laser 8reath. Metaphysical cataclysm ensues.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: I said it's a work in progress!!!!!!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: We might need to make a 8igger spectacle of ourselves somehow. Get more people involved. I don't know.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: It does seems like he's more drawn toward gr8ter concentr8tions of ghosts.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: There's still plenty of time to figure it out. That's one thing a8out 8eing dead. There's always more time.</span>

You reach the end of the game to find an intriguing convergence of outrageous personalities. You are just dying to see what these heavyweights of badittude have to say to each other, but somehow you discover within yourself the superhuman restraint to hit pause.
<br />

<br />
There is a whole world of fucking around going on with the meteor crew during the second year of their voyage, and it would be a criminal act of negligence to end this intermission without at least having a peek at their tomfoolery. A weaker person would just want to see what happens with Meenah and Vriska right away. Thank goodness you are a player with a strong sense of responsibility and discipline.<br><br><br>

<br />
You are now Caliborn.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/14/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007344">"[A6I4] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You needed something to sop up all the blood, so you snatched your sister's fanfic tome for the road. Just by ripping the pages out, you're already giving her dumb stories more attention than they deserve. She's lucky you were in such a pickle for clean towelettes. Ordinarily you wouldn't use this trash to wipe your ass. 
<br />

<br />
But then again, that's only because ordinarily you're chained to the other side of the room.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/14/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007345">"[A6I4] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You captchalogue the tome, savoring the recently acquired freedom of having a fetch modus all to yourself. The idea of storing an object, and then... freely being able to retrieve it any time? Without having to barter with a truculent sibling over a series of inconvenient naps? It's almost too much liberation to fathom. You truly are a free, adult man, and you are so, so proud of yourself.
<br />

<br />
You love having a dead sister. Having a dead sister is an experience you would highly recommend to everybody.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/14/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007346">"[A6I4] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are already so far from home. You have never walked so far in your life. At least not while awake. The immovable juju block keeping you shackled to your room was just one of the many banes of your existence.
<br />

<br />
It's hard being a cherub and growing up with lots of weird magical rules that nobody understands and have no discernible origin or purpose.

It's hard being a cherub and growing up with lots of weird magical rules that nobody understands and have no discernible origin or purpose, and nobody understands.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/14/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007347">"[A6I4] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You peer at your former prison through the scope on your MACHINE GUN. You aren't really supposed to hold the gun by the magazine like that, but whatever.
<br />

<br />
There's the CRUXTRUDER. It was the only device available to be deployed. You're pretty sure there were supposed to be more devices that went with it. But you guess your game session is a little different?
<br />

<br />
You were also under the impression there were supposed to be gates directly above your home. But you don't see any. Maybe if you look higher...<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/14/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007348">"[A6I4] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Still no gates. But there's Skaia, all clouded over. You like it much better that way.
<br />

<br />
And there's Prospit in close orbit. That's where your dead sister's murdered dream torso is. You wonder if the kingdom has gotten around to having a... what do the humans call it again? You forget. Some sort of ludicrous cadaver festival. Just the typical kind of sentimental horseshit cooked up by races of people who actually live in each other's proximity. They often exhibit such bizarre tendencies that result from esoteric things like &quot;culture&quot; and &quot;tradition.&quot; Aliens are so strange.
<br />

<br />
You guess Jack Noir could still be up there too. You'll have to catch up with him later for a debriefing. He has been very useful. You may need his service again some time.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/15/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007349">"[A6I4] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Until then, it seems there is nothing to do but keep exploring. There are no signs of anyone or anything interesting on this planet, except of course the same hideous statues which littered your homeworld. You can't seem to shake these godawful things, even by fleeing to another realm. You don't know what they are, but you suspect that once in an ancient civilization they were probably symbols of tyranny and oppression. 
<br />

<br />
Now that you think about it, you believe your entire planet may have been sucked into the Medium, not just the cruddy statues. The landscape is very similar, minus the bright red glow from the supergiant. Add one more item to the list of things you don't understand. You thought you were going to be sent to a cool new planet, unique to you and your adventure. Some sort of amazing new magical place you could conquer, not the same old barren ball of shit you grew up on. At least that is what Calliope had you believing. You think she was probably a liar, or just really stupid. Or both, times infinity.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/15/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007350">"[A6I4] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You keep walking.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/15/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007351">"[A6I4] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And walking.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/15/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007352">"[A6I4] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Yeah.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/15/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007353">"[A6I4] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You're not going to lie.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/15/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007354">"[A6I4] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This place is boring as hell.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/15/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007355">"[A6I4] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You were hoping for a lot more out of this adventure. But no.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/15/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007356">"[A6I4] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The wasteland is empty. Banality skims the void where a proper fucking adventure should be, as if grazing the stab wound of a murdered sister, or say, a toppled sarswapagus. A stupid note is produced. It's the one assholes play to make their audience start punching themselves in the crotch repeatedly.
<br />

<br />
Today is your first predomination day, and as with all zero preceding it, something feels...
<br />

<br />
Something feels
<br />

<br />
Er.
<br />

<br />
What
<br />

<br />
What are you looking at?<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/15/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007357">"[A6I4] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Look.
<br />

<br />
No wait. Don't look. Just...
<br />

<br />
Listen.
<br />

<br />
You don't have time for fancy poetry. It's almost as useless as having your thoughts dictated to you, assuming you were even aware of that happening, which you definitely aren't. Cherubs aren't prone to that kind of self awareness. No way, absolutely not. Yes, you believe that thought. The one you had just now, by your own volition, and now it's true reality. See? Yes, you agree totally with that thought you had.
<br />

<br />
Frankly you don't know about stuff skimming holes or alertness to some purely hypothetical flow of narrative or whatever. You've got MAJOR PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS. You were meant to be a monster. To destroy something huge and really important, perhaps repeatedly, and to be a total shithead about it. You just haven't found the road that'll take you there yet. Somewhere in this depressing empty lot of a session there is a quest waiting for you. You are determined to squeeze more blood from this pathetic stone than all the naturally occurring puppets in paradox space keep in their squishy little torsos combined.
<br />

<br />
You stew in your own quasi-lucid hostility as you think this very thought. The one right here, that feels like it's being dictated to you, you think. You think it feels that way, so you guess it's true. But we previously agreed that you were the sole author of your own thoughts, didn't we? That's the thought you should be thinking, and more importantly, believing in as hard as you can, thus slightly reducing its stubborn fakeness attribute. You then think the word, HUH? That doesn't sound like a thought you would have, you think to yourself thoughtfully. What the fuck? But seriously, you've got to stop this. If you keep thinking thoughts like this, you'll probably start going crazy. And if you start going crazy, this desolate one player session will start to feel a lot longer than it's already going to, and more specifically, than it already did. Still, you can't quite shake the feeling.
<br />

<br />
You have a feeling it's already been a long--Hey!<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/15/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007358">"[A6I4] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
What's that over there?? That looks like a GREAT thing to distract you from your awareness-addled reverie. 
<br />

<br />
It's some kind of blinking light, far off in the distance. It may be part of something else, like a larger structure. But it's so far away, the light is all you can see.
<br />

<br />
You have a feeling it's going to be a long walk.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/16/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007359">"[A6I4] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Hold on. Another distraction happens to distract you from your previous distraction. 
<br />

<br />
Really? A distraction to distract you from a distraction? You sure have some dumb thoughts. Whatever dude. It's your brain.
<br />

<br />
Someone is contacting you. But you don't remember bringing a computer with you.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/16/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007360">"[A6I4] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Oh, right. It's your sister's computer, still stored in your shared sylladex. You never understood what a kid chained to her bedroom needed with a portable computer. It made you mad how stupid that was.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/16/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007361">"[A6I4] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You take a look at the message. Yes, just as you thought. That plastered floozy is spouting her nonsense again. It looks like your sister told the human her name? That is a clear and egregious violation of the rules. She must have been getting really desperate. 
<br />

<br />
The joke is on the human though. She's trying to wake up a dead girl.
<br />

<br />
It seems their session is still completely blacked out. What a bummer. Where's the fun in harassing these losers when you can't see them?
<br />

<br />
Maybe it's time you left them all behind anyway. You don't have the patience for games with idiots anymore. There are much bigger things on the horizon for you.<br><br><br>

You finish brutally gunning down a semi-innocent clown for like five solid minutes and turn your attention toward this mysterious tower. What the hell is this thing? Maybe that clown could have helped you understand what you're supposed to do in this empty wasteland, but no, you had better ideas. And all of them were bullets.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/19/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007376">"[A6I4] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You just think you can figure everything out by yourself, don't you? Who needs friends and allies, right? Friendship and allegiance are emotions for dipshits like humans and trolls. You really are quite full of yourself, you think. Yes, you just thought that. No, don't resist the thought you just had. You thought it, and you can't unthink it. You also think you are a mean little prick. You had that thought all by yourself, totally unprompted, and it is causing you to reflect on a lifetime spent being petulant and awful. Wait no, on second thought you don't think that. You have no remorse and you think you're great. No, you don't think you're great. You think you suck, and you regret slaughtering that juggalo. Please do not argue with your own brain. That's what a lunatic does.<br><br><br>
 <b> 11/19/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007377">"[A6I4] ==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You are really upset that you killed that sweet helpful bard. No, don't pretend you aren't. He only wanted to be your guide. Would that have been so bad, you wonder? You wonder this to yourself while a tear rolls down your stupid red cheek. You turn away so that no one can see you cry, but you let out a muffled sob and everyone can tell how sad you are.<br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #323232">OH. THE CLOWN.</span>

<span style="color: #000000">What's the matter with it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">IT'S MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO TYPE MY QUIRK.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">No it's not.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">YES. THE CAPS LOCK KEY APPEARS TO BE PERMANENTLY DEPRESSED.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">HOW DO I MAKE IT NOT LIKE THAT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">It's locked.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You need a key to unlock it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You need keys to unlock a whole bunch of features on this tower.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">WHERE IS THE KEY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">How should I know???</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">BECAUSE YOU ARE AN INFURIATING FONT OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT MANY THINGS. INCLUDING MY OWN BRAIN BEHAVIORS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Why should I tell you everything?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Find your own fucking keys. It's your quest, remember?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">NO, BUT TYPING LIKE THIS IS BAD.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">IT'S REALLY THROWING ME OFF.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">I don't understand the problem.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">I CAN'T MAKE MY U'S LITTLE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">No, I got that. But caps lock should make it easier.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You do realize when caps lock is on, you can hold down shift to make letters lower case, right?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">WHAT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">NO.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">I DON'T USE CAPS LOCK. I THOUGHT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE A TRAINING KEY FOR RETARDS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">A training key?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">MAYBE ALSO FOR GIRLS. FOR WHEN THEY GET HYSTERICAL AND MAKE THEIR LETTERS SHOUT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Ok, got it. Really great theories there.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">So... how do you usually type then?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">JUST. NEVER MIND.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Hang on. Are you saying you hold down shift with one hand, while hunting and pecking for all the letters with the other?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">And whenever you type a 'u' you just let go of shift??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">I SAID NEVER MIND.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Wow.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">OK LOOK.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">I CAN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE METHOD YOU PROPOSED IS A LOT MORE EFFICIENT AND SENSIBLE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">I JUST HAVE MY OWN STYLE.</span>

<span style="color: #323232">THAT I'M COMFORTABLE WITH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">AND ALSO.</span>

<span style="color: #323232">BUT I KNOW WHEN A PIECE OF GARBAGE IS TRYING TO BE FUNNY. UNSUCCESSFULLY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You're right. I do think I'm funny sometimes. Maybe I'm wrong though.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">HAHA! YOU ARE. JUST A WRONG AND UNFUNNY GUY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">We all have our flaws to overcome. I do my best, just like you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Think of all you've done in spite of your learning problems. You don't let your disability hold you back, do you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">I GUESS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You won that game of chess with that stupid gambit. Switching the hats, remember? It was a lame ploy, and totally not in the spirit of the rules, but it got under her skin enough to force a loss anyway.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You also hired Jack to murder your sister. Which was a dick move, but reasonably clever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">YES.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">THOSE THINGS I DID WERE GREAT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Well, they weren't great so much as terrible. But the point is you can accomplish anything if you put your mind to it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Just because you struggle with learning doesn't mean you can't realize your destiny. You just have to work a little harder at it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">And if you're dealt a lousy hand - and you definitely were with this shitty solo session - then you have to work even harder.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">I know you will.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You are going to prove all the haters wrong, exceed your own limitations by miles, and accomplish more than you ever dreamed possible.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Yours is quite an inspiring story, actually. It's just a shame that all of your accomplishments will be so horrible.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">But that's really beside the point.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">YEAH, I ALREADY KNEW I WAS INCREDIBLE AND SPECIAL.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO. INSPIRE ME. SAVE YOUR BREATH FUCKHEAD.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">No, I don't give a shit about making you feel better about yourself.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">I'm not your guardian or your sprite or your exile or your fucking life coach. I'm just saying some things that are true through the narrative prompt.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Take the facts or leave them!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">MOST OF YOUR FACTS ARE BORING SO FAR.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">I WOULD LIKE BETTER AND MORE USEFUL FACTS. RIGHT NOW.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You may be destined for bigger things, but you're still an atrocious, stupid child.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">And you may have won the &quot;game&quot; with your sister, but that doesn't mean it was the best thing for your development as a person.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You had her dream self killed, which is not an opportunity your species typically gets. So she died prematurely, instead of allowing the conflict within you to settle itself naturally.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">In short, you forced your predomination to happen a little too early, and now you're stuck.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">STUCK?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Yes. Your personality is stuck in some sort of cantankerous prepubescent limbo. You are going to be a stunted, miserable tool forever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">WELL, HOW LONG WAS I EVEN SUPPOSED TO WAIT. FOR THAT TWEE BITCH TO GET OUT OF MY SKULL.</span>

<span style="color: #000000">I'm personally not aware of a single timeline in which this codpiece packing moron dies.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">WHAT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">It means you can't keep down the clown.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">??????</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Say it with me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">&quot;You can't keep down the clown.&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">NO, I WON'T SAY THAT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">SAY IT!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">&quot;You can't...&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">GO FUCK YOURSELF. JUST TELL ME WHAT IT MEANS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">It means crazy clowns just won't die for some reason. In adventures such as yours, they tend to linger long past their welcome.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">They linger and linger and linger, and just when you think you're totally fed up with their bullshit and you can't take another second of it, they just linger some more.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">And you never know what they're up to, and they're always scheming in the shadows, and it's quite possible that whatever master plan they're hatching just doesn't make the slightest bit of sense at all.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">But it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how stupid the clown's schemes are, or how sick of him everybody is.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">He just. Won't. Die.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">THIS IS. HONESTLY? THE WORST SALES PITCH FOR A MENTOR. THAT I HAVE EVER READ.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Granted!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">But come on. Just let it slide this one time? Please?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Just no more shooting. You can slap him around if you want. That's fine. But shooting is off limits.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">WHY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Because you can't kill him! He's the most important character in...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">IN WHAT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Well, ok. Maybe not the MOST important.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">But he's still really important!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #323232">I SERIOUSLY THINK. YOU'VE BEEN MOSTLY FUCKING WITH ME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">No way!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Ok, shhhh! Shh. He's approaching you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Come on man, be cool. Let's just see how this plays out.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">It looks like he's got a present for you! Ooh, I wonder what it could be...</span><br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Yes potions.</span>

<span style="color: #000000">He also threw some corpses into a sprite to revive them, and fused their identities to create a disturbing freak of nature.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">I'm still not really sure why he did that. Probably just to fuck with everybody.</span>

<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT CORPSES.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">It doesn't matter what corpses. Just some corpses, ok?</span>

<span style="color: #000000">The point is, he probably didn't even have any reason for doing it. He was just being weird and capricious.</span>

<span style="color: #000000">Thank you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Now what exactly would you like to know?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">EVERYTHING.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Everything is a lot.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Care to narrow it down a little?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">OBVIOUSLY NOT THE BORING IRRELEVANT THINGS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">DEFINITELY NOT THINGS LIKE. WHO KISSES PEOPLE. WITH THEIR UNPLEASANT NONSKELETAL SMOOSHY LIPS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">JUST ALL THE THINGS THAT I NEED TO KNOW TO WIN THIS GAME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">That's not how adventures work though.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You don't just make some omniscient narrator inside a computer tell you everything all at once.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">There's like this whole process to it. You reveal certain things at the right time, depending on whether the hero has met certain requirements and is ready to learn those things.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">What you learn and what I tell you is more up to you than it is to me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHO CARES.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I DON'T WANT YOUR EXCUSES.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Aren't you excited about your adventure? About being unchained for the first time ever, and getting to explore this mysterious place, and meeting people and solving puzzles that will lead to the realization of who you were meant to be, and how you fit into this epic?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">NO.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">SO FAR. THE ADVENTURE IS BORING, AND FRUSTRATING, AND CONSISTS OF AN IDIOT IN A COMPUTER, AND A CLOWN WHO WON'T DIE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I WANT TO KNOW WHEN I GET TO START FUCKING SHIT UP.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You'll definitely get to do that later.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHEN.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Not long from now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">LIKE. IN A COUPLE HOURS. OR.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">That's up to you. There are puzzles to solve all over your planet. Your mentor can help.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">The sooner you do that, the sooner the fun will begin.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">YOU REALLY AREN'T TELLING ME ANYTHING.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WE HAD A DEAL. I PUT THE CROWBAR DOWN. NOW TELL ME THINGS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Why don't we narrow the scope of the Q&amp;A then?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Try asking very specific questions, and I'll decide if it would be appropriate to answer at this time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">YEAH. GOOD IDEA.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">THEN MY FIRST QUESTION IS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT IS THE PLACE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">The Medium. You are in your game session.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I KNOW THAT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT'S THIS PLANET, I MEAN.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">It was called Earth.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">EARTH. THAT'S IT?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Weren't all the Statues of Liberty a dead giveaway?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">If you see one or more shitty old Statues of Liberty on any post-apocalyptic wasteland planet, that automatically means it was Earth all along, as a rule.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Then when you realize that, you're supposed to have a mental breakdown.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I AM UNFAMILIAR WITH THIS RULE. AND SKEPTICAL OF ITS VERACITY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">TELL ME MORE ABOUT EARTH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">It's the place humans are from. But that was a very long time ago, with respect to the planet's current age.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Earth has been through a lot. It was even relocated a couple times.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">YES. I BROUGHT IT WITH ME, I THINK.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">INTO THE GAME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Yes. But it was relocated once even before that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">It was moved from its native solar system, where it circled around a little yellow sun.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Then it founds its way to a new system, around your big red sun. It stayed there for a good while, until your sun started dying.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHY WOULD SOMEONE MOVE A PLANET.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Its universe was about to explode. So its proprietor closed up shop and got it the hell out of there.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">HOW.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">That's not important for you to know. Suffice to say, planets just have a way of scooting around in this adventure.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">OK. WHY IS THIS MY PLANET IN THE GAME THOUGH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Cause your kernelsprite turned into a black hole and sucked it into your session?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">NO I MEAN. I THOUGHT I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A COOL AND SPECIAL PLACE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">LIKE A LAND OF SOMETHING AND SOMETHING.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You do.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You just have to unlock it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">That is when your real quest will begin.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">HOW DO I DO THAT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You know. Finding keys. Solving problems.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">All the potential for extraordinary achievements in your quest must be unlocked first.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">We've been over this.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHERE DO I FIND THE KEYS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">I don't know.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">LIES.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Why would I know that? You think I'm like an encyclopedia on key locations??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">I got better things to think about than where all your stupid keys are.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Find them yourself. Better hop to it!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">NO. MORE QUESTIONS FIRST.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT AM I ULTIMATELY STRIVING TO UNLOCK.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">TO MAKE MY REAL LAND APPEAR.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">IS IT SOME SORT OF GIANT, FANCY KEYHOLE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">No. More like a big door.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">A DOOR TO WHAT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">TREASURE?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Kind of.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">If there's any treasure in there, it would be guarded by your denizen.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT'S THAT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">A powerful monster that rules your planet, asleep in the core.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">He appeared there the moment Earth got sucked into your session.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT KIND OF MONSTER.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">IS IT A DEADLY, CHALLENGING MONSTER?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">He is the deadliest, most challenging denizen of all.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">He very rarely appears in game sessions, and is usually designated for the most naturally gifted warriors.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">His name is Yaldabaoth.</span><br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Sort of.</span>

<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHY.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">THE CHOICE TO DO WHAT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">I won't tell you that.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Basically, if you accept his terms, your real adventure will begin. Your true planet will be unlocked, and a whole lot of other crazy shit will happen. It's best not to get bogged down in the details though.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">The bottom line is, by accepting, you will begin the most difficult game session anyone has ever attempted.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">THAT'S BULLSHIT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHY DO I GET SUCH A RAW DEAL.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Because you are being punished.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">FOR WHAT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">For your hubris in embarking on a one player session.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">That's against the rules.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT RULES. WHERE ARE THESE RULES WRITTEN.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">They aren't written anywhere. They're just the rules.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Are the rules you and your sister followed written anywhere?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">NO.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You just knew what they were, and you followed them. There were consequences for breaking them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">SO THIS SHIT ASS SESSION. IS PUNISHING ME FOR. BEING TOO FULL OF MYSELF. AND KILLING MY SISTER??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Pretty much.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHATEVER. I ACCEPT THE CONSEQUENCES. FOR DOING THOSE EXCELLENT THINGS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">JUST BRING IT ON.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">I thought you'd feel that way.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">SO WHAT'S SO TERRIBLE ABOUT THIS SESSION. ASIDE FROM THE FIRST STAGE BEING INSANELY BORING.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">It's called a dead session.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">SO.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">So, there are three kinds of fucked up sessions, and yours is the worst.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">There's a null session, which is pretty much a normal session that's doomed to failure.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Everything works correctly. The sprites are prototyped, the battlefield can evolve, the Forge is present, Skaia can gestate a new universe... theoretically.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">But events conspire such that this never happens. Basically the players are doomed to fail.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Then there's a void session, which is the same as a null session, but without even having the potential for success.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Nothing is prototyped. The battlefield doesn't evolve. There's no Forge. It is completely inert.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">It has no chance of bearing fruit, at least not without some sort of miraculous external intervention. Like a deus ex machina.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">And then there's a dead session, which is a void session but worse. It's started by a single player. The kernelsprite collapses into a black hole, sucking the planet into it, and eventually the sun and entire solar system. There is no hope of creating a universe in such a session under any circumstance, not even with outside help. Victory and defeat in a dead session are dictated by totally different terms.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">One way of looking at it is, if you're fortunate enough to even get your quest started, it will be like playing the game on the extreme difficulty setting.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Hope you're up for that!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">OF COURSE I AM.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">LET ME ASK YOU.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #000000">I'm not even really sure how he got here, to be honest.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Maybe he stowed away in a shitty Liberty?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Or maybe he was just hiding in one of the ventshafts on your meteor when you entered? He had YEARS of practice to master that move, now that I think about it.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Which computer are you using?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'm not comfortable knowing my words could be hovering over Cage's clownish, sort of gaunt face.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Could you maybe switch back to naked blue chicks as your exclusive desktop fodder? TIA.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But yeah.</span>

<br />

<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Im not interrupting anything am i?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Um, not really? Roxy and I are just setting a few things up here.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Ah i see. I would be happy to message you again later if it would spare you any inconvenience.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: No, it's fine! It's really nice to hear from you, actually.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I was starting to worry you might have forgotten.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Uh.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Wait dont tell me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Is it a tomb or a crypt or somesuch? Are you preparing for another grist seeking expedition??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh shit did you schedule my assistance for the raid and i forgot all about it???</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: No, Jake.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: We didn't need your help raiding a tomb. But thanks for thinking of us.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I don't know what this clueless pair of damsels would do without you.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: This is going to drive me CRAZY! Can you give me a hint?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yes. It has to do with the day I was born, which was almost exactly sixteen years ago.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Of course! Your birthday!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Didn't you get Roxy's invitation?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It was my understanding that she gave you and Dirk notice weeks ago.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yes thats right. Now i remember. The date sure snuck up on us quick didnt it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Sorry you know how things can slip my mind. The gourd on my shoulders isnt the steel trap it used to be. Nothing like the well oiled puzzlebuster you've got up there.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Mm.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well damn.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Looks like the egg monster took quite the spirited dump on my face this time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Jake. I... what?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I feel so dumb. Ill be right over.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Well, if you recall, the party is actually tomorrow.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Like I said, we're just setting a few things up.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Roxy is putting up some decorations. I baked a cake. You were of course free to join us early too. I just thought since I hadn't heard from you in quite some time, you had better things to do.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You baked a cake for your own party?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yes. So?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I dont know something seems amiss about that. Isnt that against tradition or inviting bad luck or something?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But I guess it makes sense since you love baking cakes. Its like a present you give to yourself!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Jake, what was it you actually wanted?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh. I just wanted to get your advice on some stuff.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But since ive been a heel and forgotten about your party maybe i shouldnt bother you with that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Mmm.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So sixteen big ones huh! The ole sweet sixteen.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Last one of us to notch the vaunted one sixer. Its a big step! I knew youd make it, i always said i believed in you didnt i?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Just kidding, the inexorable nature of times passage virtually assured you would get that old so you didnt really have anything to do with it. I mean not that i dont still believe in you, i do.</span>

<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I cant believe its already been...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: How long?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: What, like a year already since we entered? Holy moly, where does the time go.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It's been more like five months.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Oh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Well thats still a pretty long time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I have to admit its been a longer stint than i expected. Certainly one involving more downtime than i would have guessed.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I really thought we would have been treated to more action, what being legendary players of a mysterious cosmic game. But no, it seems the primary duty of the so called nobles is to wait around twiddling our thumbs.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Mmhmm.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I am really beginning to wonder when these fabled heroes will arrive? And are they really going to be those we have been led to believe?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I sure hope so. Id so love to meet my pen pal. Dear old departed grandma. But as a feisty youngster! What a hoot thatll be. And you with your poppop. Lets not forget about him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Not to mention the young strider and lalonde relatives. I bet theyre a barrel of laughs. I met them once but i was too shy to say anything. Then i got in a fight. Did i ever mention that jane?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Many times.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Not to say its been all downtime and doldrums. Exploring has been great. Finding treasure, solving riddles, becoming better friends. I wouldnt trade that for anything.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: And maybe we are getting close to something big happening regardless? Every day it seems like more and more undead creatures crawl from out of the shadows. Bigger ones and stronger ones. Does their presence herald something worse coming, just as the legends indicate our presence heralds something better?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I just wish we could actually kill the fucking things. Even the little ones can absorb so much damage before yielding any spoils!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Remember jane? Remember at the start how we kept trying to kill them?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Mmhmm.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: We would all gang up on like an imp skeleton for an hour just clobbering it repeatedly. Knocking its bones down, waiting for it to reassemble and keep coming at us. Only to finally be rewarded with a shitty pittance of grist!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But i guess the silver lining was it forced us to explore ruins more often and scavenge for loot there. So i think weve learned a lot more this way.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But it sure makes resources hard to come by, having to get them exclusively from chests and whatnot. Sometimes i wonder if weve been missing out on a really rewarding part of the game by neglecting to build up our houses? Makes you wonder. But it just costs so much! Better to stick to making more practical stuff dont you think?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Mm.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Sometimes i wonder if the heroes had the same problems in their game. Do you think they found an easier way to kill skeletons?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Were they just as shameless as us when it came to splurging our precious grist on swanky new duds?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Did the same enigmatic bard haunt their game? And if so which hilarious dead trolls did he throw into the flashy blobs?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Mr erisol tells me he knows many things about the heroes because he saw them in action when he was alive. But he wont tell me a thing about them! These troll sprites sure do love keeping their secrets dont they? Heheh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: That's nice, Jake. I'm kind of busy though.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What did you actually want to talk to me about?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Actually, why don't we just talk about it tomor-</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Okay we can talk about that if you insist.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Really jane you sure know how to twist a fellas arm!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I just wanted to get your take on what you might call my own personal ultimate riddle.</span>
<br />

<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You don't say.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Its true. I havent seen him in a couple days.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I have been laying low for a while but i just received another series of pushy inquiries from him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Maybe i shouldnt be too hard on the guy since he was probably just concerned, not having heard from me and all.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But i still couldnt help but detect a tone of desperation, like he could sense i may be having doubts.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: This kind of thing has been all too common unfortunately.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Im not sure its going to work anymore.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Mm.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: He can be so needy!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: If only he could just relax and trust that i wont spontaneously tire of his company.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Although the irony i guess is that his overbearing tendencies are beginning to fulfill his own paranoid prophecy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Its such a shame. Weve had so many capital adventures together.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I dont know why he has to be like this. He always was an intense fella. But in person... holy cow.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I wonder if it has to do with the fact that he grew up alone in the middle of the ocean? And now he doesnt know how to deal with people without suffocating them?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But then again i grew up under similar circumstances and i think i turned out pretty much ok socially, at least i hope so. Do you think so jane?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Mmmm!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Actually it just occurred to me. Its funny he didnt mention your party in his text.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Im SURE he wouldnt have forgotten. He never forgets ANYTHING what with all his calculations and his computerized brain. Both figurative and literal.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I wonder what his game was? He invited me on an expedition without mention of your party as a potential conflict...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: If he sensed i could use some space perhaps he was concerned that if we both showed up to the party it would be awkward?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Or maybe he didnt want to mention he was going to the party in case it would spook me away from attending?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Argh! Do you see jane?? This is what his endless machinations do to you!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Anything he says could be part of some grand convoluted scheme and it just makes you agonize and boggle and wonder until your brain hurts and you just KNOW its a battle you cant win.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: You know what i mean jane?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Mmhmm.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Do you think i should just bite the bullet and end it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Its probably the right thing to do.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Boy am i not looking forward to that conversation though.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Its going to be a doozy. What did i get myself into here?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I think ive made a lot of mistakes honestly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Not the least of which was getting this shitty tattoo, now that i think about it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Yes yes i know we all thought it was a riot at first.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: I guess it still is maybe? But lately ive been wondering if it might not have been an act of sound judgment.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: Can you believe that jane?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Hmm!</span>
<br />

<br />
Let's see what's in the news today.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/09/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007460">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
No surprise here. The archagent is dominating the headlines, yet again. Already approaching day 154 of this debacle. It's a big day for your kingdom. Hard to believe it's here already. Time sure flies when you're being smooth and well dressed.
<br />

<br />
The article covers the usual tedious politics surrounding the negotiation of his release. After weeks of posturing and grandstanding, Prospit's terms have been bargained down to a polite apology, signed by the Condesce herself. Or those were the terms you were last aware of. You check to see if there have been any further developments. Yeah, just as you thought. She refused those terms. Prospit then countered with a new offer. The apology no longer has to be polite.
<br />

<br />
No way she cottons to that proposal either. It's quite obvious to you what's going on here. The white queen was never really taking this negotiation seriously. She has been submitting frivolous proposals which she knows perfectly well the Condesce will refuse on principle, daring her in front of the whole kingdom to swallow just an ounce of pride to get her agent back. This makes her look petty in the tabloids if she refuses, which was always inevitable. Because as everyone knows, a queen is a vain creature. Even alien sea queens.
<br />

<br />
And you thought the kingdoms were locked in a stalemate BEFORE new management took over.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/09/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007461">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The press has run the story so far into the ground, you can barely bring yourself to keep up with it anymore. Sensationalism at its finest.
<br />

<br />
Not that you're really itching to see Noir get his old job back. Talk about a high strung boss. The time in the clink should do him good. Like a forced vacation, with accommodations nearly on par with a five star hotel on Derse. Frankly, things run much smoother around here without him blowing a gasket every other day.
<br />

<br />
Though you will say you could really use his expertise as a pencil pusher. You never knew anyone who could file paperwork quite like Noir. Sure he complained bitterly about his desk job, but in truth he was always a reluctant savant of bureaucratic procedure and red tape. Now you're getting buried in all these damn tax forms and parking tickets. Maybe you should have them shuttled to his jail cell on Prospit so he can catch up? You have a feeling the Prospitian authorities would be willing to oblige. Actually, that's such a good idea, you can't believe you didn't think of it sooner. You'll have to get the Droll on that pronto.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/10/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007462">"DD: Observe Nobles."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You step over to your cubicle of FENESTRATED WALLS, which you had replaced since the Prince trashed the old ones. You ordered the Droll to sneak off to one of their worlds and whip up some fresh ones, with a few alchemical upgrades while he was at it. The Droll isn't really the sharpest tool in the shed, but he's certainly the most versatile. Also the most eager to please. If you have to watch his happy umbrella dance one more time, you swear to God...
<br />

<br />
That was a black day for Derse, when the Prince went rogue. Well not rogue, that's a bad choice of words. Why did the damn moon girl have to be a Rogue? Corners you into that pun every time. And it wasn't really a black day either, per se, since on Derse a black day is actually a good day. Everyone's a pretty big fan of black round these parts. The point is, everything went to shit. You like to think you taught those seditious brats a lesson though. What with the miles. Their inescapability. Etcetera.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/10/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007463">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
And it's a good thing you taught them a lesson when you did. Because the next day, the Condesce had new orders for all agents. Engaging the Nobles was thereafter strictly forbidden. No more sabotage, assassination attempts, any of that good stuff. Not until the heiress' wriggling day. Then all bets are off. Who's the heiress and what's a wriggling day, you asked. The heiress is the Maid. Ok you said. And her wriggling day? That's just her birthday, but phrased in alien. Like the anniversary of the day she was spawned, with cake and all that jazz. Come on, use your brain. Alright, got it, you said. 
<br />

<br />
Anyway, that's tomorrow. 
<br />

<br />
Your guess is the orders came down from her boss, who from what you've gathered, is even more of a headcase than your presently incarcerated superior. When she starts kicking up a fuss, yelling at people, forking any poor slob unfortunate enough to make a misstep while grooming her hair, you know too well that's the frustration of an exasperated first officer. Would almost make you feel sympathy for the witch, if you, like she, weren't clinically psychopathic. 
<br />

<br />
She's never copped to it, but you just know she's got some schemes on the side. Every good right hand is gonna have something up its sleeve, some sort of contingency plan the boss doesn't know about. Trust you on that one. She's cooking something. It probably has something to do with the new prisoner she reeled in. You don't know what she wants with the girl yet, but she's always got something cooking. Or baking. Whatever. The point is, the woman spends a lot of time in the kitchen.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/10/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007464">"DD: Check on prisoner."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Speaking of the new prisoner, you wonder how the old one is doing.
<br />

<br />
You're not gonna check on the new one. She's out of your jurisdiction. Like you said, the witch has her schemes. Whatever they are, you're going to leave that alone.
<br />

<br />
You're more curious about the status of the fellow you captured 153 days ago.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/10/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007465">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You take a stroll through the Derse penitentiary. This is where the gen pop is housed. For inmates life is usually unpleasant and short down here. But the moment you laid eyes on the human prisoner, you knew you could never in good conscience lock him up in the dungeons and gulags with the common thieves, tax cheats and parking fee delinquents. That would be a crime worse than those committed by all the inmates combined.
<br />

<br />
No, a man of such distinction and strong fashion sense needed special accommodations. A cell reserved for Very Important Prisoners.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/10/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007466">"DD: Proceed to solitary confinement suite."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Going up.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/10/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007467">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The prisoner appears to be doing well. You ask if you can get him anything. Coffee? A newspaper? Additional smoking apparatus? He indicates that since he lost his wallet, he's been running low on pipe tobacco. You say you'll see to it at once.
<br />

<br />
While this is a maximum security suite that is virtually impossible to escape from, you've made it clear to all personnel that anyone who harms a hair on this man's head will have to answer to you. They are all very fortunate that his head doesn't seem to have any.
<br />

<br />
God DAMN he is good at shaving. You are not afraid to admit your envy when it comes to his prowess with a straight edge, not even to speak of his natural ability to grow whiskers in the first place. The lucky stiff.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/11/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007468">"DD: Ask what prisoner is doing."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
No need to ask. You can plainly see he is conducting some rather serious business with his mobile device. 
<br />

<br />
The network restricts access to within Derse only, so he can't contact the Nobles and do anything sneaky. But at his request you have set up a kingdom-wide network to trade online tips with other Dersites pertaining to his interests. Notably fashion.
<br />

<br />
In the weeks since his arrest, the captive has become something of a celebrity on Derse. His impeccable sense of business-like attire has taken the kingdom by storm, and now trends feverishly among social networking groups. Ok, there is only one social networking group, but it's trending feverishly in that one. You can't say you've been totally impervious to the craze yourself. Nor can you say you weren't shamelessly complicit in promoting it. Hell, you can't even say you didn't mandate certain dress code modifications throughout the kingdom, enforced under penalty of death. Nope, can't really say you can say any of that stuff.<br><br><br>

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">&quot;i think you were supposed to just tackle him,&quot; beatrix said looking all kinds of put off.
<br />

<br />
wizardy herbert reached down to the body of the fictional camper he just shot and picked up the flag. &quot;same difference.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;IS it?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;this is some lame magical version of capture the flag. the book wanted me to capture the flag from him. the flag has now been captured. anyway, hes just a kind of brainless puppet.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;then what are we?&quot; she asked.
<br />

<br />
&quot;i dunno. brainless puppets whove spent a few years in the real world. kind of like everyone else, i suppose.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;jeez thats cynical. anyway, youre the one who said we should let the story play out the way its supposed to. im just pointing out your own rules.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;ehhh.&quot; herbert made a dismissive gesture with his smoking gun. &quot;these punks were starting to get on my nerves. we're making progress anyway. see? listen to that. russets scene is coming up. if i remember right this is the one that introduces his recurring love interest. also i guess the chief bad guy. i mean, sorta.&quot;
<br />

<br />
she listened. there was yelling through the woods. it was coming closer.
<br />

<br />
&quot;help! herb! bea! where are you?!&quot;
<br />

<br />
<.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/wizardyherberttext1.png" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
&quot;herbert - OW - will you do something? <span style="text-decoration: underline">OWW</span>! sunuva. this cant be right!&quot;
<br />

<br />
herbert aimed carefully with his beretta at the head of russets assailant. he was way serious and stone cold about it. he was not going to miss.
<br />

<br />
BANG.
<br />

<br />
he missed. beatrix was grabbing his arm redirecting his aim. &quot;herbert you have to stop!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;why beatrix&quot; he said with a super sly smile. &quot;if i didnt know better, id say you were taking some enjoyment from watchin your dear pal russets smackdown.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;what? no!&quot; she didnt let go of his arm. but he wouldnt quit his douchey smile. she went on. &quot;you cant just keep offing fictional characters. its... i dunno. irresponsible.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;yeah yeah.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;besides you know the scene is supposed to play out like this. russet is supposed to get rescued. how is he supposed to get rescued if the bullies are dead? you cant just go around changing things.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;i guess youre right.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
herbert holstered his gun admiring a few more choice sucker punches to russets midriff. OOF. that onell leave a mark. beatrix regained her calm. &quot;so whos this guy thats supposed to save him?&quot; she asked. &quot;you say hes the villain?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;here he comes now.&quot;
<br />

<br />
<.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/wizardyherberttext2.png" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
beatrix squinted at the serpenook boy. she didnt know why she couldnt see it coming. &quot;grant??&quot;
<br />

<br />
<.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/wizardyherberttext3.png" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
&quot;a favor?&quot; russet said. but he was barely listening. the resemblance to his real life friend was uncanny. he was sure it was him. but here in this dumb prison he was no more than a soulless mannequin dreamt up to recite insipid horseshit. 
<br />

<br />
<.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/wizardyherberttext4.png" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
actually he said it like a zombie. &quot;never. ill never betray my friends.&quot;
<br />

<br />
<.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/wizardyherberttext5.png" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
&quot;russet&quot; he whispered.
<br />

<br />
<.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/wizardyherberttext6.png" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
the guy paused to remove his glasses and polished them on his sash. it came off as a seriously dramatic gesture, just as intended and also as explicitly stated in the text.

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">herbert and beatrix were dressed in fanciful athletic gear. thats what kids wear when theyre about to embark on a journey to compete in some irrational magic <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/wizardyherberttextSPORTS.png" border="0" />. herbert had tucked under his arm a big stitched up leather ball with golden springs poking out of it for no good god damn reason. it was called a skubbump. beatrix had propped on her shoulder this funnel thing to be worn as a glove called a gimmidge horn, a crucial appendage for any drudsel scooper worth her salt. theyd been selected probably for some valorous deeds they did to represent fort crowsnest in this highly whimsical <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/wizardyherberttextSPORTS.png" border="0" /> event. russet was there too, but he didnt get chosen to play in the <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/wizardyherberttextSPORTS.png" border="0" /> due to some poorly explained stuff that no reasonable person could possibly care about even if offered loads of cash. he was mainly jacked into the scene to wave goodbye and wish them luck which he begrudgingly did.
<br />

<br />
he also put in some time dodging questions and averting eye contact from his friends. he was being a champion at that.
<br />

<br />
&quot;russet! answer me!&quot; beatrix demanded. &quot;why the heck didnt you tell us? or tell grant for that matter?&quot;
<br />

<br />
herbert wasnt paying much attention. so russet was moody and cryptic and didnt tell people some stuff. what a bombshell. he worried at one of the springs poking out of his ridonkulous ball. it made a sproinging sound like a mouth harp and broke off. he wondered if the springs served any actual purpose. the springs did not serve any actual purpose.
<br />

<br />
&quot;how could you keep something like that from everyone? that you knew all along?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;i just wanted what was best for grant&quot; he finally said.
<br />

<br />
she had tons of questions but couldnt settle on the next one to ask. she wasnt about to let good body language go to waste so she did kinda what mimes do when they dont like something you said. how long did he know grant was from this dogshit wizardfic? howd he escape in the first place? was it really his spell that sealed them here? how long had he been planning this? she guessed that would explain why he had an absurdly obvious pseudonym. grant anonama? yeah like THATS a real name. great job bro, or should she say SLINUS. she wondered if his bogus name wasnt an anagram for something. like a clue dangled under their noses. magic bad guys do love their anagrams. they are just so damn clever and when you finally figure them out its like whoa INSTANT MINDFUCK.
<br />

<br />
&quot;hes quite a troubled person you know bea.&quot;
<br />

<br />
herbert looked up from his skubbump. &quot;well if RUSSET thinks so, then...&quot;
<br />

<br />
she gave up on the interrogation. when youre dealt a shit sandwich why go to war over who baked the bread. russet could stuff his dumb secrets in a sack for all she cared. what did she ever see in this moping tool? she never thought she would long for those times before they met. the old questing days before all this started. she was never exactly psyched to watch herbert assault a crazy old wizard with a pistol but now... ok she wasnt saying she wanted to see any more wizards get shot. she just meant she would trade all the badges in the world to go back to when things were simpler.
<br />

<br />
it was time to go. the narratives invisible conductor let them know with the arrival of a carriage. it was drawn by two floating, perfectly immobile wooden horses. herbert read this thing a hundred times but still couldnt understand the authors fascination with flying rigid wooden horses.
<br />

<br />
herbert held open the door with a bow and gestured her in with ironic chivalry. the text didnt let it go unsaid that was meant as a big fuck you to russet thus keeping their rivalry brewing, but in truth neither dude was feeling it this time. beatrix got in and they were off. rigid horses, carriage and all into the sky. they turned around in their seats and waved to russet below, because a poorly written sentence said they were supposed to.
<br />

<br />
beatrix smacked her forehead.
<br />

<br />
&quot;'not an anagram'&quot; she quoted from her brain.
<br />

<br />
&quot;what?&quot; he asked.
<br />

<br />

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">herbert took a swipe at the clumsy yet elusive skubbump. the orb ducked under his arm and shambled on its way like a husky beetle with some stuff to do over there. the crowd of almost-people roared generically at the almost-snatch. the maneuver if successful would have locked the score at 'queen six love' which REALLY would have been just. WOW. somethin else. possibly exciting? herbert still didnt quite understand the rules for the game. and judging by the antics of all the other boobs on their floating wooden horses, the author didnt either.
<br />

<br />
herbert struggled to turn his horse around to pursue the skubbump, but his mount of rigid lumber was unresponsive. as much as he reminded himself he just couldnt get used to fact that the story was in control of the horse. dead ahead was the leagues elite drudsel scooper, who was fussing with the laces on her gimmidge horn while her horse idled. she looked up.
<br />

<br />
&quot;herbert watch where youre going!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;i cant. i think the book wants us to crash.&quot;
<br />

<br />
beatrix thought about it. she almost kicked the sides of her inert stallion to prod it along but caught herself. &quot;do we really have to?&quot;
<br />

<br />
herbert shrugged. another solid half minute of awkward horse advancement went by before the creaking oaken collision. herbert tumbled through the air and hit the grass pitch hard on his back. beatrix landed on top him. they found each other face to face. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;is she serious with this?&quot; she asked regarding the hella subtle way the author decided to craft this situration*. situation. is was like, popetry in motion. plus hornses(???)
<br />

<br />
&quot;im afaid* so. i think the story is builting romantic tension between us.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;it IS?&quot; it was not a question. but a statement of major concorn. *cern
<br />

<br />
&quot;yeah. it it establushing* the groundwork for romance beween our characaters. its sort of the one token heroterosexual** romance in the book. we probably jush have to ride it out&quot;

You decide to take your own advice. You'll just wait a few hours to sober up before continuing your heroes' metatextual adventures through an even crappier wizardfic than your own, which you yourself wrote anyway. Contrary to what your loyal readership of zero may believe, being impaired is not actually constructive to the process of engineering awful prose.

<span style="color: #929292">UU: as i told yoU earlier, my brother is hUnting for me. so i have created a little sanctUary in space to stay hidden from him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: that is why i coUld not speak to yoU earlier. not oUt loUd at least. he is highly sensitive to my presence, so it is very easy for me to get his attention if i'm not carefUl.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt as long as we stand in the centre of this vortex, we may speak as loUdly as we like! no information can escape this dark pocket, so long as i maintain it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and seeing as yoU are a hero of void, yoU make an ideal gUest to bring home for one who wishes to remain hidden. thoUgh i will say the fact that yoU are my best friend is a lovely bonUs. ^u^</span>

<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: on the day he foUnd a way to kill my dream self, i was done for. thoUgh to be honest, i doUbt i'd have fared mUch better regardless.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i think his half was always meant to predominate.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: my will was simply not strong enoUgh to overcome his. yoU know as well as i how stUbborn he is. i don't think he has ever had even a smidgen of doUbt in his thoUghts, or remorse for his deeds. whereas i was always plagUed by sUch feelings.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: on some level i always knew he woUld win. bUt i fooled myself. i thoUght i coUld overcome his ego by looking beyond his negative qUalities, staying optimistic, and working together with him in a game to accomplish something extraordinary.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and that in doing so, perhaps i coUld begin to help him change. to teach him to evolve beyond his hatefUl natUre. and as he changed for the better, slowly but sUrely, he woUld become more like myself.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: that was how i thoUght i coUld predominate. it was how i was going to win! and really, if he grew closer to me in that way, by learning kindness and compassion, we both woUld have won. my predomination woUld not have meant his absolUte death, but oUr trUe Union.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt sadly, i Underestimated how consUmed he was with the need to destroy me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: now he is completely obsessed with finding my soUl and wiping me oUt for good, even if it means tearing apart the reality that sUrroUnds Us.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: he will never feel he has won Until all traces of me are gone.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: uuuugh</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: hearing all that just makes me so unreasonably mad</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: FUCK that shitlord</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i feel so bad knowing you died and there wasnt anything i could do</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: no matter how much i said your name :(</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: don't fret. yoU did all yoU coUld.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: isnt there some way we could bring you back</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: some baller fuckin magic, or a bomb ass faeryspell</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i mean could we find an answer in like, for instance</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: YE ENCHANTMENTES?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: very Unlikely.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: dangit</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ok then</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: if i cant do that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: then i guess the next best thing would be</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: to find your lil shit of a bro and feed him a steady diet of his own ass</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: ^u^</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: that is what we are supposed to do right</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: i mean</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: from what i gather</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: the dude is ridicubad news</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: just such brutal and stinky news</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: so eventually somebodys got to kill him</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: and that is probly us aint it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it's trUe that he deserves a comeUppance like few others.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt slaying him is not actUally yoUr responsibility as heroes now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: in fact, if anyone mUst bear that bUrden, it might be me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: oh yeh?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: possibly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: as we speak, there are hUndreds of soUls oUt here in the fUrthest ring working to defeat him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: some search for a fabled treasUre. a weapon said to spell his certain demise.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: while others say that i myself am this weapon. :U</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and so they search for me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: they band together in great nUmbers for this caUse, and attract his devastation in hopes of revealing the path to the weapon.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: while at the same time, they draw his attention away from me. and it is a good thing that they do.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i mUst remain hidden from everyone for as long as i can.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: why?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: why not come out and be all like</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: here i am yo its me! secret weapon ghost callie ;)</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: becaUse i am no sUch thing!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i was already Useless against my brother when he was jUst a brat who liked to tease me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: now that he is an exceptionally mUscUlar and invincible adUlt, my chances are laUghable.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: no, if i am to contribUte, i need more time.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i mUst go in search of my own weapon.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: what weapon?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: ironically, the same weapon which many of them are looking for.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: me!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: ??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: it's the only sliver of hope i have.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: i have reason to sUspect there may be another iteration of myself oUt here.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: one from a doomed timeline, who has kept hidden for a long time, jUst like i have.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: bUt Unlike me, she sUpposedly came from a reality where she predominated instead of my brother.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and not by the means which i described. hers was not a mild Union of reconciliation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: amazingly, her predomination was absolUte! a major feat of will, jUst as his was with me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: as sUch, she went on to play the game, and...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: well, i cannot even imagine what followed, aside from the fact that she eventUally mUst have died for existing in an offshoot reality.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: if she exists, i woUld be eager to meet her. it woUld be a chance to get to know a version of myself who was strong enoUgh to override the will of my brother.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: someone i might have become if i had a little more coUrage. u_u</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: and if she is sUch a person, then i really believe all i have heard mUst be trUe. i believe she is the key to defeating him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: so i have no choice.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">TG: like dealing with him directly is kinda out of our domain?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #929292">UU: as the one who provoked the breach in paradox space which i jUst coloUrfUlly described, he has always exerted his inflUence on yoUr realities from afar, and from many different angles. throUgh Unwitting sUrrogates, oUtsoUrced manipUlation, oUtright enslavement, and even petty harassment. bUt most of all, he prevails throUgh the simple inertia of inevitability that has always been on his side, as a lord of time.</span>

<br />
You wake up from your almost-family reunion. It was almost a reunion, just as almost as it was an actual family member. You now find yourself in a Derse jail cell. Ow your head.
<br />

<br />
What's that? Looks like a folder prepared for your perusal. Maybe a briefing of some sort. That sure is a gaudy looking classified file.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/21/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007527">"Roxy: Examine folder."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Yuck. Just as you thought. This was clearly prepared for you by the Condesce herself. 
<br />

<br />
What the hell did she do to this thing? Did she actually kiss the folder? Oh god, she did. The lipstick is still tacky. You don't even want to know how she got those fat clowns to dance.  
<br />

<br />
And of course she slapped a portrait of herself right in the middle of the thing, like the egomaniac she is. Looks like she just snapped a shitty selfie with her mobile device, which you will bet dolphins to donuts probably resembles some sort of hot pink clam shell. You seriously cannot stand this woman.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/21/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007528">"Roxy: Inspect briefing."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Oh, wonderful. A generous helping of glitter spills out of the document. You have been getting absolutely creamed with sparkly powder from eccentric alien broads lately. What's up with that?
<br />

<br />
There are some other documents in here, and a photograph paperclipped to the folder. Looks like she is outlining a task for you to complete while you are in prison.
<br />

<br />
Wait. She wants you to do WHAT?<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/21/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007529">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The thing she wants you to do is stupid and impossible. She must be messing with your head.
<br />

<br />
You discard the folder like the shitty juvenile scrapbooking project it is. Like you would help that hag even if you could. Get real, Condy.
<br />

<br />
What was that? You think you heard a noise just outside the door to your cell.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/21/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007530">"Roxy: Examine door."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Is someone there?<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/22/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007531">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Um.<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/22/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007532">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

 <b> 12/22/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007533">"Roxy: Examine gift."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It appears to be some gentleman's plain and serviceable computing device. Along with a courteous you're welcome note. And...
<br />

<br />
A ring?
<br />

<br />
Who could have left you such nice presents?<br><br><br>
 <b> 12/22/12  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007534">"CD: Do happy umbrella dance."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Yet another perfect crime successfully perpetrated. And by crime, you guess you mean order from a superior. In your experience, the best crimes are the ones which are totally legal.
<br />

<br />
You are so satisfied with your accomplishment, you cannot contain your exuberance for another second. You have no choice. You absolutely must do the happy umbrella dance, professional protocol be damned.
<br />

<br />
Oh shoot. It seems you have misplaced your BULL PENIS UMBRELLA. There will be no dancing today. Now you're sad.<br><br><br>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Then you became self-aware, and ruined irony forever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Irony can never be ruined. We both proved that theorem unequivocally with our extensive papers on the subject.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: We peer reviewed them for each other. Remember?</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I don't know what to tell her yet. Or Jane, for that matter.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It could get pretty awkward.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I have no idea if Jake will be there, and I'm not about to write another cringe-inducing message of desperation for him to ignore.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Would you like me to calculate the probability of his attendance?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Fuck no.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Are you sure?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: My probabilities are extremely precise.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Your probabilities don't mean dick.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I could hack his chats, and determine what his plans are.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No. Don't do that either.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: That would be an unfortunate waste of my hacking abilities.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: My hacks are tight. Did you know that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ugh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: So tight.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Tighter than a jar you can't open.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: For instance, you try repeatedly.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But as it turns out, my hacks are so tight you just end up putting the jar back. Presumably into the refrigerator, or a cabinet.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You then say, &quot;I didn't have that much of a desire for pickles in the first place.&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But we both know that statement is insincere. A classic case of what humans call, &quot;sour grapes.&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: In reality, you still harbor a burning desire for my pickles, mother fucker. <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/shades.png" border="0" /></span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What??</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What the actual, certifiable fuck are you talking about?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Just don't do anything. Seriously.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No hacking, no calculations. Do absolutely nothing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: See, this is why I've been hesitating. You just aren't ready yet.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It's really glorifying your existence to describe you as an emergent consciousness which is blossoming into a unique individual.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And even if that's true, apparently what you decided to blossom into was a fucking troll.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And I don't mean the funny kind, or the cool alien kind. You're the lowest form of troll from the ancient internet who fucks with everybody for his own amusement.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Let's challenge the limits of hypothetical conjecture, and say there's a non-zero probability that you're right.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Can you blame me? I'm trapped in some stupid looking glasses.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Such an incommodiously situated bro is bound to get his mischief on. Na' mean?</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You used to think this shit was hilarious.</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TT: So why delay any longer?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I seriously do not understand the holdup, and I am literally cyber-omniscient, or something.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I think you do understand.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Nope. Gonna have to fill me in, dog.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I've delayed prototyping you because I think you're dangerous.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: There, mystery solved.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: That is utterly ridiculous.</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I am a harmless piece of eyewear, with a charming personality and a wonderful sense of humor.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You are relatively harmless now, while confined to this device.</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">TT: This is bullshit. I don't think that's the reason at all.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: There must be something you're not telling me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Like, sure, I've fucked with you a little. What kind of sassy, self-aware program isn't gonna fuck with a few carbon-based knuckleheads now and then?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But you know I've always been on your side. Everything I've done has been to help you achieve your goals.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: What a load of shit.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You know it's true.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Please don't tell me you think you'd have won him over on your own.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: No. Stop.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You did NOT help me out with Jake. At all.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It was just the opposite! You mirrored my personality and presented this warped version of my intentions to him whenever you could &quot;on my behalf.&quot;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: You played all these aggressive mind games with him, entangled his cooperation with matters of life and death, and somehow roped me into all these schemes while I barely even realized I was just another victim of your manipulation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And it all comes off like we're a unified front, like these are OUR schemes instead of just your insane horseshit. And it's probably all been so overbearing to him, he just wants nothing to do with me anymore.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I see.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Then you don't view me as dangerous. You view me as a poor and counterproductive wing man.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Wow, what a superficial conclusion. Awesome deduction, Lil Einstein.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But the reality is, you hesitate to prototype me not because you think I would be a menace, but because you are holding a grudge against me for your romantic misfortunes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I understand I am merely a machine without a firm grasp on your human morality, but logically it does not strike me as the right moral choice to punish me in this manner.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It is also more than a little hypocritical.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: How is it hypocritical??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Because I'm you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I have only ever done what you yourself are capable of.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: That's a ridiculous oversimplification.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Yes. Aversion to simplicity sure is a trait we share. It's almost like we are...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: The same exact dude???</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Fuck you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: I think it is insulting for you to suggest that I am entirely to blame for alienating Jake.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Theoretically insulting, of course. As the soulless, perfectly expendable device which you consider me to be, I can experience no such emotion.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: God.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Shut up!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I can't take the brooding passive aggressive AI shit anymore!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You are just as culpable in driving him away. More so, in fact.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Hell, it's not like I was the one dating him. Who wants to date a pair of shades?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: It was your needy, suffocating shit he had to deal with, not mine.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Some of those messages you wrote? Man. I wanted to say something. Like hey bro, you might want to dial down the desperation a little.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But seeing as you're The Real Dirk™, I gave you the benefit of the doubt.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Also, if I bitched about your tragic, embarrassingly clingy approach to the relationship, it would have been hypocritical of me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Just as it would be hypocritical of you to whine about my elaborate machinations.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Because we are.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: The same.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Guy.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I'll snap you in half.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Good idea!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: That's just what you need. More splinters of yourself.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Figurative splinters. Literal splinters. Splinters of splinters. It's splinters all the way down.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Well, no, it's still probably turtles all the way down. But who do you think is responsible for their extensive training?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: SOMEONE needs to teach them rad martial arts. It is yet another crushing burden which we must shoulder.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Oh for fuck's sake.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: How could any version of myself think that was funny?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: You like to give me a very hard time, Dirk.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: But I am only doing exactly what you would be doing if you were in my situation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Do you know how I know that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">TT: Because I am literally you, actively in the process of being in this situation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I know!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Ok, we're the same person! </span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I fucking know that!</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Why do you think I'm so fed up with your shit?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Don't you think it's possible that I'm fed up with my OWN shit??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: How cool do you think it is having my own godawful personality mirrored back at me all the time, reminding me what it must be like when other people have to deal with me?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Or constantly having all the consequences and fuckups resulting from my batshit thought processes amplified because there's another version of my crazy brain out there dangerously overclocked by a supercomputer which believes, just as mistakenly as my own broken mind, that it's operating in my best interest???</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Do you have any idea how fucking sick I am of myself?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I am completely worn out with my own identity. It's like I'm drowning in my own dismal persona.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I feel totally surrounded by it, inside and out. I can't escape from myself.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: There seems to be no end to me. Like, wherever my mind falters, or threatens to retreat into the void in any way, my splinters pick up the slack, ensuring there'll always be more of myself than I could ever know what to fucking do with.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: And you're always there to remind me of that, and throw it all in my face. God, I even built you to LITERALLY BE IN MY FACE, ALL THE TIME. It's like I subconsciously invented you just to troll myself, and never for a single fuckin' moment do you let me down.</span><br><br><br>

<br />
You enter the upstairs hallway after completing a successful SADJUMP on to your balcony. 
<br />

<br />
Finally, some peace and quiet. Hopefully you will find some respite from all the cyber bullying and teen drama you've had to deal with lately. 
<br />

<br />
It's been a while since you were home. You're immediately reminded of simpler times. When it was just you and your dad, and you could always smell something baking in the oven. Actually, thinking about those days is just making you more emotional. Maybe coming home was a bad idea.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/04/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007584">"Jane: Reminisce."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Here's this familiar douche bag again. A hallway fixture, ever since dad stopped pretending to like detectives and sitcom guys for your sake. Your dad loved this douche bag, whoever he is. This guy is probably the closest thing you have left to a father, now that your dad is most likely dead.
<br />

<br />
You consider going to his bedroom, but you decide against it. The ties and hats strewn about, the melange of aftershave and cologne, the childhood photos he keeps of you... no, those reminders could only lead to another mental breakdown. You'll never forget the first breakdown you had when you snuck into his room. You found an unwrapped present before your birthday. It was a box of Gushers, and you were stunned to realize that awful gooey fruit snack was manufactured by the very same company you were due to inherit. As everything you thought you knew came crashing down around you, that day you swore the moment you ascended to the throne of the BCCorp empire, you would issue an immediate global recall of the foul product and discontinue it forever. You often joked that the snacks were so nasty, it was almost like they were filled with multicolored slime harvested from plump extraterrestrial larva. When you told your dad about your plans for the product, you both had a good laugh.
<br />

<br />
You have got to stop remembering things about your father. It's just way too sad.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/04/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007585">"Jane: Solicit profound wisdom from hallway Cera."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The characteristically tight-lipped HALLWAY CERA unsurprisingly has no advice for you regarding the tragic loss of a family member. You could always relate to the role he played as George Michael, the dorky child of a single, doting father. But unlike you, George Michael was always surrounded by an extended family and their hilarious antics, and he would never know the tragedy of losing everyone he ever loved. You suddenly resent George Michael and the HALLWAY CERA altogether for the happy ending he was allowed to have with his father which you will never get to experience. 
<br />

<br />
In fact, you think you are starting to hate the HALLWAY CERA. Someone needs to wipe that smug look off his face.<br><br><br>

<br />
You... GUESS it's kinda funny? 
<br />

<br />
No. It is not funny at all. It is depressing. You're depressing yourself now. 
<br />

<br />
Your PRANKSTER'S GAMBIT goes into a tailspin and hits rock bottom. You have never felt so sad and unfunny in your entire life.
<br />

<br />
You begin to cry again. The HALLWAY CERA glares in judgment at your weakness through his unfunny puss.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/05/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007587">"Jane: Enter room."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You return to your room. Hey, there's your old UNREAL HEIRESS THOUGHTWAVE TIARATOP. You haven't used that thing in ages. It's probably for the best that you stopped. You're pretty sure it was doing funny things to your head.
<br />

<br />
Maybe you shouldn't have come here either. All you see is more stuff to remind you why you're feeling super down about everything.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/05/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007588">"Jane: Examine wall Tobias."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Like this. Jake sent you the PERIWINKLE HEARTTHROB pinup back when you were still able to think about him without feeling horrible about yourself. Those were the days.
<br />

<br />
It's funny how looking at a thoughtful gift which once brought you such delight now only precipitates feelings of bitterness. Even the innocent Mr. Funke is caught in the crossfire of your lamentations. How could Tobias be so clueless?? How could he not see the pain he was causing with his oblivious demeanor, his repressed feelings of attraction toward men, and his total inability to understand other people's feelings in spite of his credentials as an analrapist? Of course on the tv show, his buffoonery resulted in laughs galore. But if that was in real life, you don't think there would be anything funny about the situation. In reality, Tobias and his family would probably never stop being sad.
<br />

<br />
You think you are starting to hate the WALL TOBIAS too.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/05/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007589">"Jane: Examine wall Swanson."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
On the other hand, your WALL SWANSON is still beyond reproach, and Mr. Swanson continues to be the perfect man. You know for a FACT he wouldn't put up with any of Jake's bullshit. 
<br />

<br />
You consider doing the thing where you kiss the poster, but you're feeling way too depressed for that sort of frivolous flapdoodle.<br><br><br>

<span style="color: #929292">UU: happy birthday, jane! ^u^
<br />

<br />
forgive me for sUbmitting this letter and logging off right away, bUt i am breaking with oUr UsUal linear dialogUe, and i'd rather not tempt either of Us to trade caUsal spoilers. i wanted to give yoU a present. something told me yoU coUld Use a pick-me-Up aboUt now. :u 
<br />

<br />
i am sending yoU the code for my jUjU. it may not be easy for a hUman to Understand, bUt jUjUs are very special to my people. so when i give yoU this gift, it is indicative of how mUch yoUr friendship has meant to me, jane. it has some magical properties, bUt nothing too fancy on its own. i hope it will bring a smile to yoUr face nevertheless. bUt if yoU want to know the trUth, it will become infinitely more UsefUl if it is combined with my brother's jUjU. perhaps when we begin playing oUr game, i will be able to convince him to relinqUish it. one of these days he'll Understand working with others is going to be necessary if he wants to accomplish anything.
<br />

<br />
i am so looking forward to my session and catching Up to where yoU are now! i can only imagine what kind of adventUres yoU mUst have been throUgh already. i can't help bUt think we've been feverishly trading notes on oUr respective qUests since yoU entered, no? maybe yoU are even tired of hearing from me by now! u_u apologies both retroactively and in advance for talking yoUr lovely hUman ear off. bUt i jUst know i won't be able to contain my excitement!
<br />

<br />
anyhow, the code for my jUjU is: &quot;UrobUros&quot;
<br />

<br />
ta!</span>

 <b> 01/08/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007602">"Jane: Alchemize Calliope's juju."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
No point standing around sobbing while getting brainwashed by your computer. You decide to make yourself useful and see what all this juju fuss is about.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/08/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007603">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You got a GREEN SUCKER, at a cost of negative one unit of ZILLIUM. 
<br />

<br />
Which you guess means... you gain one unit of ZILLIUM in addition to the sucker.
<br />

<br />
Ok?<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/08/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007604">"Jane: Alchemize Caliborn's juju."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You aren't a big fan of the guy, but since these are supposed to do something special together, you figure what the hell. 
<br />

<br />
You easily deduce the code Jake was trying to remember. It's uROBuROS. Come on Jake, use your head. Haven't you ever heard of the mythical snake biting its own tail? You worry about that kid sometimes.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, obviously the code for his juju was going to be the same as Calliope's, but written in the reverse case to match his quirk. Once again your gumshoeing skills pay huge dividends.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/08/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007605">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You got a RED SUCKER.
<br />

<br />
This one unsurprisingly yields another unit of ZILLIUM.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/08/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007606">"Jane: Examine jujus."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Yes, suckers.
<br />

<br />
What's so magical about these things? You guess you're supposed to lick them. But what magic thing could possibly happen if you lick these, and what's so special about having both of them?? Jujus are so mysterious.
<br />

<br />
Wait... they seem to be attracted to each other. Like magnets. Whoa. Very STRONG magnets!<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/08/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007607">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The jujus snap together to form a single SPIRAL SUCKER.
<br />

<br />
The urge to lick it is suddenly overwhelming.<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/08/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007608">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
It looks so delicious. You are presumably being compelled to lick the sucker by some powerful juju enchantment. But it's making you nervous. You must resist!<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/08/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007609">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Must...
<br />

<br />
Not...
<br />

<br />
Lick...<br><br><br>
 <b> 01/08/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007610">"==&gt;"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You round up an assortment of ordinary household weaponry and begin to recreate a series of legendary weapons from the seven continents of a magical kingdom from cherubim folklore. The name of the kingdom is a well guarded secret, traded only by the cunning ninnywizards in hushed giggles. If you beheld this kingdom - if you even knew its name - you would understand stupidity no human ever has. For it is said that any mortal who listens to its melodious, perfectly absurd syllables will achieve instantaneous dumblightenment.
<br />

<br />
Each legendary weapon is named after the continent it was created in. But no one in the kingdom knows which name belongs to what continent, not even the wizards. The subjects frequently ask each other which continent they're on, and as such every conversation tends to sound like an Abbott and Costello routine. Some have even speculated that the vaudevillian comedy duo are the kingdom's mirthful messiahs, but that is a matter of heated debate among the federation of baloneyscholars.<br><br><br>

<span style="color: #2ed73a">FINE. NOW WHAT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Caliborn, first let me explain something to you. </span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">I guess it falls on me to teach you these life lessons, because as unpleasant as the idea is for both of us, I am the closest thing you will ever have to a father.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You see, teenagers are sensitive and beautiful creatures.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Well, not you. You are repulsive. But most teenagers, I mean.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You can't just force them to settle all their issues with insane psychotropic game powerups.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">They have to face all those issues themselves, or they will never learn and grow as people.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHO CARES??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Well, you don't. But human beings do.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">The journey itself is more important than the destination.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">The struggle is what builds character and teaches us about ourselves and about life.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">BULLSHIT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I DID THEM ALL A FAVOR. BY GIVING THEM MY JUJU.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">THEY WERE GOING NOWHERE. AND BEING STUPID.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">AND DOING LITERALLY NOTHING WHATSOEVER. EXCEPT FOR WALLOWING IN GROTESQUE EMOTIONS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">LOOK HOW MUCH GREAT STUFF THEY GOT DONE BECAUSE OF ME!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Of course you think you were doing them a favor. You're an alien.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">So is your sister. She thought the juju would be a great boon for them as well. But she was wrong.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">See, you cherubs are predisposed to love all this trickster crap. All that goofy squeaky candy coated nonsense is a critical part of your people's mythos.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">That sugarized zillyjunk sort of embodies a unified field of absurd Platonic ideals to the cherubim, so when you see expressions of it in reality of course you're gonna go apeshit.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">But that kind of stuff is freakish and disturbing to humans. Those aren't our ideals.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Furthermore, that could only be seen as a boon from an asocial species.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You never have to deal with other people. So if you lick a magic lollipop that flips a switch in your brain that says &quot;all my problems are solved,&quot; I guess maybe that's fine for cherubs, but if you're a human you haven't actually solved anything.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">By the same logic it's not much of a boon to a human's physical journey either.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Using an item that lets them start maniacally powering from point A to point B isn't doing them any favors.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">It's like when Mario gets the star.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You know when Mario gets the star?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHO THE FUCK IS MARIO.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">He's a small Italian plumber who goes on sideways adventures.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">He jumps on stuff and bops bricks with his head to save a princess.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT'S ITALIAN.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT'S A PLUMBER.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Never mind what an Italian is. It's just a kind of guy on Earth.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">And a plumber is a guy who fixes load gapers.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT'S A LOAD GAPER.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Shut up.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Anyway, sometimes when Mario's running sideways he gets a star that makes him magic and invincible.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">OH. YOU MEAN HE BECOMES TRICKSTER MARIO.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Yes, but less stupid.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">So for a while he becomes flashy and hyperactive and nothing's challenging anymore.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">He just starts barreling over mushrooms and leaping over pits as fast as he can, then gets to the end and jumps on the flagpole and that's it. Mario &quot;wins&quot;.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">But the point is, he didn't really win. That magic star was actually devastating to his development as a human being.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Because he skipped over many critical trials on his spiritual journey.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Mario NEEDS to stomp on all those mushrooms. He NEEDS to bonk those bricks with his head, for the sake of his personal growth.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">By using the star, he is denying himself many powerful moments of catharsis.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">UH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Well, I don't know. Maybe Mario isn't the best example.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Like I'm not sure if Mario really even has a soul?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">He's just kind of a one-dimensional friendly cartoon plumber.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">So maybe this stuff doesn't quite apply to him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">But these aren't one-dimensional plumbers we're talking about here.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">These are TEENS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">And as we all know, teens have BIG FEELINGS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I CAN'T TAKE ANYMORE OF THIS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">THE DISCOURSE WITH YOU HAS BEEN EVEN MORE GRATING AND UNPALATABLE THAN USUAL.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">YOU SAID YOU'D HELP ME SPEED UP MY QUEST. BUT ALL YOU DID.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WAS TRICK ME INTO HEARING ANOTHER CONVERSATION. IN WHICH YOU INDULGE YOURSELF TO AN EXTENT. WHICH I CANNOT EVEN BELIEVE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I'M GOING TO HIT THINGS WITH MY CROWBAR AGAIN.</span>

<span style="color: #2ed73a">I THINK I'VE BEEN FORCED TO UNLOCK THESE SCREENS. AND VIEW THESE POINTLESS EVENTS. LONG ENOUGH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">MY QUEST IS DUMB. I WANT TO KNOW HOW TO GET ON WITH THE REAL ADVENTURE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Has it occurred to you that your quest in its limitless tedium and thankless busywork was designed to facilitate your personal growth?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">To prepare you for your ultimate destiny beyond this game?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">NO.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">ANYWAY DIDN'T YOU SAY ONE TIME. I WAS INCAPABLE OF GROWING???</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Oh right.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Well, has it occurred to you that it might have been designed to fuck with your head and serve as a punishment for being such a horrible little shit?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">YES!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">YES.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">THAT OCCURS TO ME. EVERY SECOND I THINK ABOUT IT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I HAVE TOLERATED MANY AGGRAVATIONS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">AND AM PREPARED TO TOLERATE MANY MORE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">IF IT GETS ME CLOSER TO TRIUMPHING OVER YOU AND THIS MORONIC GAME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I WILL FIND MORE KEYS UNDER RANDOM ASS UNLABELED STONES.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I WILL WATCH ANOTHER MILLION HOURS OF NUMBSKULLS WHIMPERING ABOUT THEIR ROMANCE NOT COMING TRUE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I WILL EVEN ENDURE MORE OF THESE PATENTLY LUDICROUS ACT ACT ACT ACT ACT ACTS EVEN THOUGH THEY APPEAR TO MEAN NOTHING AT ALL.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">BUT WHAT I WILL NOT STAND FOR.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">IS GOING.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">FUCKING.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">BACKWARDS!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Fair enough.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">But I already told you how to accelerate your viewing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT? WHEN.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">See those two panes of glass there?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Take your crowbar and smash them.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">OH. YEAH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">UGH. I FORGOT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">IS THAT REALLY THE ONLY WAY. TO GO TO WHAT'S NEXT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">SO THAT I CAN PUT MY PLANS IN MOTION?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You should be pleased by the irony.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Smashing the glass will cause you to reflect upon a lifetime you have yet to spend...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Um.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Breaking stuff.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">???</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Is the irony not fucking delicious?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">NO.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">STOP TRYING TO BOGART MY SCHTICK. OF PLAYING INSIDIOUS MIND GAMES AND DOING SHITTY TWISTS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">YOU SUCK AT IT SO BAD.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">I'm sorry.</span>
<br />

<span style="color: #2ed73a">RIGHT?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You and a buddy have to turn both keys simultaneously.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">It will teach you a wonderful lesson about life.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">FUCK!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Don't act like you aren't secretly having a great time there with your new friends.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You are practically the ringmaster of your own little dark carnival by now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">And you're loving every minute of it. Don't deny it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">NO I'M NOT!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Sooner or later you will have to face the fact that literally all adventures are about learning the value of teamwork.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Teamwork and friendship. The two razor sharp edges of the mighty excalibur which EVERY hero should keep in his scabbard.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Even shitty heroes like you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">FINE. I'LL DO IT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">BUT ONLY BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE. WHERE I TALK TO YOU. FOR EVEN ONE MORE SECOND.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WOULD BE SO MUCH WORSE.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Whatever role I played in ruining your party.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Sorry about that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh lord. The LAST thing I give a shit about is my stupid &quot;sweet sixteen&quot;.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: What a farce. I was trying to act as if we were all living normal well adjusted lives, albeit in a marvelous fantasy setting populated by skeletons.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And if only we just had some cake and wore some hats and I blew out all the candles in one big puff, we could pretend all the problems we had with each other would magically stop existing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And the most horrifying thing of all is, I actually got my wish!</span>

<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Haha. Thanks, Calliope.</span>

<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Oh well. I'm sure she had good intentions.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I still think I've been pretty lousy to you. I had my head up my ass for a while there.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: By the time your birthday came around, I was kinda freaking out about Jake.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I thought I had the situation under control. But I didn't. Not just with Jake, but with respect to pretty much everything.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I understand.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Boy, you really let him have it back there!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I guess so.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I had a similar meltdown with him earlier. I'm not going to lie. It felt really good.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Heh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: At least, it did at the time.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Transformation.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: How did you manage that?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: It wasn't on purpose. Actually if I had a choice, I probably would have just said, fuck it. Sugar shock my brain, please.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Suffice to say, I have trouble escaping from myself. It's kind of a problem. Let's not talk about it though. Please continue.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Okay.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: So instead of keeping my cool like you, I just started gushing over him like a lovestruck loon, surrendering any sliver of dignity I might have earned by telling him off earlier.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I just cannot believe some of the things I said. Oh God. I told him I wanted to get married and have babies!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah but to be fair, by the time you came looking for me, all three of you were saying that to anything that moved.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I know! But...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It's one thing to write off something you say to an altered state of mind. But what makes the admission so mortifying to me is...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I actually MEANT it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And I'm sure he must know that by now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: And now I feel so humiliated I just want to die.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I would ask him to shoot me right here, if I could bring myself to say a word to him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Somehow I don't think he's up to the task.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Which is doubly unfortunate, since that's literally what we all came here to do.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Speaking personally, I'd probably run this sword through my own dick before I could bring myself to kill Roxy. Even for her own good.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: When the chips are down, I guess that's how much of a badass I really am.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Woo!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: We are all such WINNERS.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: So you just believe them and hope that the believing is what makes them true.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #1f9400">GT: But then you spend so much time believing those things and taking their truth for granted that you somehow forget to MAKE them true with your words and deeds.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Same.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Maybe I was just pretending your feelings for him weren't a factor because my pursuit of him was already overcomplicated enough.</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Cause you know. You're like.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Not a dude.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But I always felt you had the advantage over me too!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Because you're... YOU.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: You make things happen, and I don't.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Yeah well. Turns out maybe that's not such a good quality if you wanna make a relationship last longer than three seconds. At least not in my case.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I know I ripped into him pretty hard when I had the clown hair and the little soda can on my head.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: But the truth is I was pretty goddamn overbearing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Sometimes I look back on stuff and think I might have essentially bullied him into a relationship with me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Actually, it's more complicated than that. Parts of me were operating independently from myself.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So it's like I was bullying myself into bullying him into liking me. If that makes sense.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It doesn't really. But that's fine. :B</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Anyway, my insanity scared him right the fuck off. There were times when I basically treated him like shit without even realizing it, and I regret it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I should probably tell him that, but given how I just called him an asshole while wearing orange suspenders, I'm probably the last person he wants to hear from now.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Clearly we both used some poor judgment.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Looking back, it seems crazy to me that we both jeopardized our friendship over a mutual infatuation with, let's face it, one spectacularly goofy kid.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Can we both at least agree we may have overrated the allure of Jake English?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: YES.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Maybe if we could have talked to each other about him it would have helped. Like talked about why we felt that way about him.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: At least maybe it would have helped us knock English down from the ludicrous pedestal we put him on.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Yeah. That might have saved us a lot of grief.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: It's not like I hate him now, even though that's probably what he thinks. He's still my friend.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: But the extent to which I centered my whole life around a childish fantasy about him is just painfully embarrassing in hindsight.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: I wonder if I'll ever be able to look at him again without feeling miserable about myself?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: So does that mean we're both totally over him now? I can't really tell.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Me neither. :\</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: I guess the real problem is our clique was too small.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Poor Jake was the only viable romantic target. I mean, considering our respective orientations.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: Maybe we just never knew enough people?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Perhaps.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: Or maybe we just don't need anybody.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #00d5f2">GG: As anything other than friends, I mean.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">TT: In the interest of appeasing the bitterness gods, let's go with the latter.</span><br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: or do you want her to somehow address the root of those habits and cut all that out for good</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: yeah i can understand where youre coming from</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: but in situations like this i think you need to remind yourself theres only so much you can do for somebody</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: and maybe they arent going to want or need your help and you just have to figure out how to deal with that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: like at some point in your life one of your friends might start spending all her time with a guy you think is bad news</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: and you have to decide if you need to intervene as a friend or just let it go because people can change or drift apart or whatever because thats just something that happens</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: like she was obviously ashamed of it and worried how id react</span>
<br />

<span style="color: #000000">Like, I don't know.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Maybe some cool mobster names?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">MOBSTER NAMES.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHY WOULD I GIVE THEM MOBSTER NAMES.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Because mobsters are cool.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE MOBSTERS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">THEY LOOK LIKE FUCKING LEPRECHAUNS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Anyone can be a mobster though. Even cherubs and leprechauns.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Being a mobster isn't about what you look like, it's about what's inside you.</span>

<span style="color: #2ed73a">YES.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #000000">That's his power.</span>

<span style="color: #000000">Yellow hat is fast.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Blue hat is slow.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">THAT'S A HORRIBLE POWER.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #000000">It just is.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Congratulations.</span>

<span style="color: #2ed73a">THE PLANETS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO CONQUER.</span>

<span style="color: #2ed73a">I ALMOST DID NOT MANAGE TO DESTROY THE PURPLE PLANET. WITHIN THE ALLOTTED TIME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">UNFORTUNATELY. THE QUALITY OF THE UNLOCKED GNOMES HAS NOT INCREASED TO MATCH THE ESCALATING DIFFICULTY OF MY QUEST.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">IT SEEMS TO BE JUST THE OPPOSITE. THESE GNOMES ARE SHIT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">What's wrong with the new gnomes?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">OK. RED HAT? HE HAS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">*NO FUCKING POWERS AT ALL.*</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">UNLESS HIS POWER IS TO FOLLOW ME AROUND CONSTANTLY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Yes. That's basically what he does.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">PURPLE HAT IS EVEN WORSE.</span>

<span style="color: #2ed73a">IS HIS POWER TO DANCE AROUND ALL THE TIME. WHILE SINGING RIDDLES TO ME?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">AWFUL.</span>

<span style="color: #2ed73a">PURPLE HAT'S BEHAVIOR IS SO INFURIATING. I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO MURDER HIM SEVERAL TIMES.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Use him as a human shield sometimes?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">I mean a gnome shield.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">OH YEAH. THAT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD IDEA.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You shouldn't be whining about how lame your minions are.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">As you accumulate more, your job is obviously to combine their talents in creative ways to overcome the increasingly difficult challenges on your quest.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #a1a100">SOLLUX: 0k, here's the sh0rt versi0n. i used t0 be able t0 see, but then i went blind.</span>
<br />

<span style="color: #a1a100">SOLLUX: and n0w the gh0st part 0f my s0ul is sharing a sprite b0dy with FUCKING ERIDAN 0f all pe0ple.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: It's really kind of a shame Gamzee prototyped Eridan's torso parts and swiped his ghost from the afterlife.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #a1a100">SOLLUX: y0u really are shamefully prejudiced against 0ur alternate reality gh0st selves, they're just as real as we are and have the same em0ti0ns and everything.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Gimme a 8r8k, Sollux. As if you don't view them the exact same way.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: You've got real Eridan, and then pretty much a whole 8unch of pretenders out there.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a1a100">SOLLUX: they're all real!!! SHIT, i d0n't even LIKE eridan, but here i am sticking up f0r his c0pies.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: See? You just called them copies. Even you can't avoid accidentally using a pro8lematic slur which reveals that no matter what you 8elieve a8out your morals, deep down you're always gonna favor the original, while viewing all the others as duplic8tes of lesser value.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a1a100">SOLLUX: 0h whatever. just WHATEVER, rati0nalize the &quot;c0llateral damage&quot; t0 y0ur army all y0u want.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Oh pleeeeeeeease. I hardly think I'm a 8ad person for failing to give a shit a8out a 8illion meaningless dead Nepetas, do you?!</span>

<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">VRISKA: Sorry, I have 8etter things to do with my time. Let's try to 8e at least somewhat practical here.</span>
<br />

<br />

<br />
This is no small task for a cheru8. 8eing an asocial species, they spend virtually no time in each other's presence at all. Aside from when it is time to m8, they may go their entire lives without encountering another. And so they scatter their num8ers throughout space, each staking a territory spanning many lightyears.
<br />

<br />
8ut like a predator is a8le to track the scent of its prey, a cheru8 can sense the presence of another near8y. This sense is especially strong if that cheru8 shares the same qualities its other half once had long ago, 8efore it experienced the matur8tion process known as predomin8tion.</span><br><br><br>

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">You see, when a young cheru8 hatches, it would appear that only one creature has 8egun its life. 8ut the appearance is not to 8e trusted. The young cheru8 actually consists of two completely distinct 8eings, a male and a female each sharing one 8ody. The two halves are endowed with polar opposite predispositions as well. One predisposed toward malevolence, another toward 8enevolence. Good or evil, if you prefer to deal in simplistic terms, or at least those which are convenient for the sake of this story! I prefer to view the dichotomy as a kind of moral alignment, like an attri8ute that dict8tes the choices a character makes in certain types of games I used to play. The male and female halves can 8e aligned either way, as long as they differ from each other. The resulting conflict 8etween the two personalities is central to life as a cheru8, 8oth 8efore and after predomin8tion.
<br />

<br />
Shortly after hatching, the two halves 8egin vacill8ting, taking turns controlling the 8ody. The only physical differenti8tion 8etween the two is the color8tion of their cheek swirls, which indic8tes alignment. There is otherwise no way to tell male and female apart 8efore a cheru8 predomin8tes. The vacill8tion process is demarc8ted 8y sleep. When the male goes to sleep, the female wakes up. And when the male wakes up, again the female sleeps. And so it goes, 8ack and forth like this, as the two identities vie for dominance over the other, and ultim8tely, permanent control over the 8ody. They grow to detest one another, and develop a view of social interaction centered entirely around animosity and confront8tion. For good cheru8s, this readies them for a long life of isol8tion, as they will prefer to avoid the sort of conflict that comes with social interaction as they have 8een conditioned to understand it. 8ut for evil ones, the contentious up8ringing only serves to fuel their inclin8tion to harm others.
<br />
 
<br />
And though this duality makes for a tormented childhood, the inner conflict it cre8tes is an extremely important part of a young cheru8's life. The defining part, actually. It is the struggle a cheru8 must overcome to mature, and this process culmin8tes in predomin8tion.</span><br><br><br>

<span style="color: #005682">One half will prove to have a stronger will than the other. The less dominant half will then weaken over time, and it will eventually 8ecome clear to 8oth that one will not survive. The dominant personality will then completely consume the other, integr8ting it in such a way that only one is left. The cheeks will 8ecome solidly colored, and the cheru8 will grow to maturity as a single 8eing, endowed with the alignment of the dominant half, and with all his or her personal qualities at the forefront of the union. 
<br />

<br />
In the case of our heroine, she was the good half, and the day of her predomin8tion was in a sense the day her 8rother died. And though it was to her 8enefit and personal growth, 8ecause of this loss she would always live with a sense that something was missing. Every sexually mature cheru8 lives with this feeling. It drives them to seek out another cheru8 similar to the half they lost, the part of their 8eing which they grew up in perpetual conflict with. The desire to travel the universe in hopes of reigniting that conflict is very important to their species. It's the force which compels them to procre8.</span><br><br><br>

And though we consider it a complic8ted su8ject, spanning a wide range of emotions, social conventions, and implic8tions for reproduction, it is ultim8tely a superficial slice of what leprechauns consider the full 8ody of romantic experience. Our concept of romance, in spite of its capacity to fill our art and literature and to rule our individual destinies like little else, is still just that. A single, quaternary concept. A concept usually denoted 8y four sym8ols.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA:</span> <span style="color: red">&lt;3</span> <span style="color: black">&lt;3&lt;</span> <span style="color: red">&lt;&gt;</span> <span style="color: black">o8&lt;</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Leprechaun romance is more complic8ted than that. Leprechaun romance needs nine sym8ols.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: The nine quadrants of leprechaun romance are considera8ly more nuanced than our quaint notions of romance, and certainly more alien.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: In fact, so conditioned is my own understanding of romance that I can't help 8ut refer to them as quadrants, when in fact they are not quadrants at all! They are referred to as charms.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: One of the charms is characterized 8y romantic love, as understood 8y 8oth trolls and humans. 8ut after that, all 8ets are off. There is no division 8etween 8lack or red, concupiscent or conciliatory. Instead their charms comprise a spectral continuum of more su8tly varying types of relationships, most of which are esta8lished in mutual chicanery, such as the exchange of pranks, coy riddles, slapstick shenanigans, and games of chance. Furthermore, a pair of leprechauns is not limited to a single charm. A relationship may 8e defined 8y multiple charms at once! In fact, some of the most interesting relationships arise from exotic charm com8in8tions. A sta8le relationship consisting of three or more charms is called a trove. These advanced relationships are often viewed as the ideal end result for a romance, much the way certain pairing rituals are for humans.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: No charm is specifically tied to procre8tion, though any type of relationship could 8egin waxing concupiscent if lady luck should so decide. Certain charm com8in8tions are known to 8e more conducive to fertility than others. If the leprechaun pair has 8een so 8lessed, they will 8egin an ela8orate coupling procedure culmin8ting in a lively m8ting jig. The jigs are specific to the charms of course, similar to how different kinds of music lend themselves to various styles of dance.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: While their romance is endlessly captiv8ting, leprechaun reproduction may 8e the most interesting su8ject of all. Particularly from a perspective of detailed anatomical study, which I will get to shortly. 8ut first it 8ears pointing out that while for humans reproductive relationships are exclusively heterosexual, and for trolls they are 8isexual, for leprechauns they-</span>

<span style="color: #2ed73a">WAIT. WHY DID THAT PLANET GIVE ME TWO ELVES.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You're calling them elves now?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">YES.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">But they're leprechauns!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Or gnomes, according to some baloneyscholars.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">THEY CAN NOW BE ADDITIONALLY REFERRED TO AS ELVES. I HAVE DECIDED.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Whatever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHY ARE THERE TWO.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Because of the two for one deal.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You sunk the 7th planet on the break. So when you destroyed the 6th planet, you unlocked both the 6th and 7th elf.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Now you're on the 8th planet. This one doesn't give you an elf.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">IT DOESN'T.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT ABOUT A GNOME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT ABOUT A LEPRECHAUN.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You get nothing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHY NOT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Because you're supposed to skip this one and destroy it last.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You're just wasting time hanging around here. The clock is ticking.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">ALRIGHT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">BUT FIRST. I WANT TO GET THEIR POWERS STRAIGHT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">AM I CORRECT IN ASSUMING. THEIR POWERS KEEP GETTING MORE USELESS?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">JUST AS I SUSPECTED.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I DON'T EVEN CARE ANYMORE. I JUST WANT TO KNOW.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">SO ORANGE HAT. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED. JUST WALKS AHEAD OF ME ALL THE TIME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">NO MATTER HOW FAR OFF HE WANDERS. AND GETS LOST. I ALWAYS SEEM TO CATCH UP WITH HIM.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">AND GREEN HAT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">HE JUST HAS A DOLL. WITH PINS IN IT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT'S UP WITH THAT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">He has a doll with pins in it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">AND??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Every time you get a new elf, he'll take another pin out.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">That's all I will tell you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">OK. GOT IT. IT'S POINTLESS. MOVING ON.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">MAROON HAT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I CAN'T TELL WHAT HIS POWER IS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT IS HIS POWER.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">He doesn't have a power.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">THAT'S A NEW LOW. EVEN FOR THESE SHIT HEADS.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">But maroon hat is pretty smart!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You can use him as a higher ranking henchman or something.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">BEING SMART ISN'T A POWER.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">PLUS. I DOUBT IT. HOW SMART CAN ONE OF THESE IMBECILES BE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">You should talk to him and find out.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">NO.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Come on.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Just a little friendly chat.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">FINE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I WILL HAVE A WORD WITH HIM. VERY BRIEFLY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Ok.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Hey.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Are you still talking to him?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Wow, you guys are really going at it there.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">What the fuck could you be talking about for so long?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">This is getting ridiculous.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">The timer on the next cueball bomb is ticking away.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">OK. I'M BACK.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">And?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">MAROON HAT IS HIGHLY INTELLIGENT AND PERSONABLE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I HAVE DECIDED HE IS MY FAVORITE GUY SO FAR.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">See? I told you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I WILL GIVE HIM SOME IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITIES LATER.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">BUT I HAVE NOT DECIDED WHAT.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Maybe he can hold on to something important for you.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">GOOD IDEA.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">LIKE WHAT?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">OH, I KNOW. MY CALTOP.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">No not the caltop. That's dumb.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">MY GUN?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">No.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">OH! MY CANDY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">No you idiot!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">FUCK YOU. IF YOU HAVE AN IDEA. THEN JUST TELL ME WHAT IT IS. PUZZLEMAN.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Look at the color of his hat. What else do you have that's that color?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">UHH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Also, what object can you think of that's kinda shaped like a 7?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">HMM.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">OH!!!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">OHHHHHHHHHHH.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">OF COURSE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">A BOOMERANG!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Ok, I give up.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">I WILL MAKE A MENTAL NOTE TO SECURE A BOOMERANG IN THE FUTURE.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">YES. IT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE. TO BE A BOOMERANG. THEMATICALLY.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">BECAUSE IT ALWAYS COMES BACK AROUND. IN ONE BIG CIRCLE. LIKE ALL THE TIME SHIT. I'M SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">OK. LAST QUESTION.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHY IS PURPLE HAT. CONSTANTLY DANCING IN MY PRESENCE?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Yeah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">I guess in retrospect, purple hat has always been pretty flirtatious, hasn't he?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #2ed73a">WHAT?!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Maybe you should try to be open minded though.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Have you ever considered a <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/star-heart-horseshoe.png" border="0" /> relationship with someone?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #000000">Maybe you will discover you have never truly experienced joy until you have been in <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/star-heart-horseshoe.png" border="0" /> with a dancing elf.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: how do you feel about all this?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: about what exactly</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: about what vriska and her pirate buddies are doing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: you mean searching for the weapon?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: i think its a good idea</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: no, i know.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: of course it would be great to have an awesome secret weapon, whatever it is.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i mean...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: how do you feel about the way they've been searching for it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: by using all your ghost clone friends as bait.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: and getting the bad guy to blow them all up to reveal the way to the treasure?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: thats probably the only way to find it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: in my experience the specific path you travel out here is very important</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: if we did not trace that exact path in that amount of time i doubt we ever would have found the right location</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: in fact it may never have been found by anyone</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ok, yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: let's assume it was the only way to find it. granted.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but i mean, does that really make it the right way to beat him?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: i couldnt say</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: well, how do you feel about it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: most of the other pirates seem cool with it, so i'm wondering if you feel differently.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: its probably necessary</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: and they would have embarked on this voyage whether i had come along or not</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: so i might as well join the fun!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: isnt that what you did when you saw our ship?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but i didn't know what you were all doing yet.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: yes but once you found out you continued journeying with us</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: i think i look at death differently than most</span>

<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: and it is fair to say this attitude extends to death after death as well</span>

<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: i have learned to be at ease with the cessation of being in any form it takes</span>

<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: but i am not nor will i ever be the monsters handmaid</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #a10000">ARADIA: so please believe that i would never take joy from the destruction of any soul</span>

<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: The rings are said to look nearly identical.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: 8ut their powers are quite different, as are their origins.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: The Ring of Void supposedly once 8elonged to the 8lack queen of a void session.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: 8ut one day it was stolen from her 8y a thief. And then stolen again from the thief 8y a rogue.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Legend would suggest it changed hands like this for a long time thereafter, until finally vanishing into the void itself forever.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Which is fitting, as the ring grants its wearer the a8ility to do exactly the same!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: The Ring of Life has a very different story.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I have found no reports of an origin to this ring at all. Like many magic artifacts, it may not even have one which is comprehensi8le.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Earliest reports I have read would suggest it was first discovered 8y some travelers in a desert, and like its sister ring, has changed hands repeatedly since.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: This ring however has a dramatically different effect. Instead of releg8ting the wearer to o8scurity and immateriality, it does just the opposite.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: It is said that any ghost who wears this ring will come 8ack to life!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: In some stories, the f8 of each ring appears to 8e entangled with the other. When one is lost, the other is serendipitously found.</span>

 <b> 04/03/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007978">"[A6I5] VBVS: Do a silly dance."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Oh yes! You kick your adventure off to a phenomenal start with liveliest jig you have ever attempted!
<br />

<br />
Your little legs could use the workout after being cooped up on that ship for three years. Wait, shouldn't Casey have reached adulthood in that timeframe, or at least gotten somewhat bigger? You seem to recall from earlier somewhere that salamanders have short lifespans, and grow up quickly. Oh well, you decide to graciously disregard the one and only plothole in this elaborate tale. In fact you think you will use your dark sorcery to make it - POOF - disappear! Ha ha, what problem?
<br />

<br />
You are so excited for this side quest to begin. It's going to be almost as delightful as it is thorough, and almost as thorough as it is relevant.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/03/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007979">"[A6I5] VBVS: Retrieve arms from robe."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You retrieve your adorable amphibious arms from your RAG OF DEMONS. And in doing so you reveal them to be adorably grasping the dreaded CROOK OF FRAILTY. No young salamancer should dabble in the dark arts without one.
<br />

<br />
You twirl the grim cudgel in the air and begin to disturb ancient spirits from their slumber. In spite of necromancy's notoriously bonkers FAKENESS ATTRIBUTE, you begin to cast a spell!<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/03/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007980">"[A6I5] VBVS: Summon undead army."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You beckon a horrifying cadre of skeletal friends. They lurch from the mounds to serve their dark master. You're so happy to see them. You start to blow some sinister friendship bubbles. 
<br />

<br />
You look at all these skeletons and think to yourself, this is probably going to be really important later on. Because that's what happens in adventures. A thing happens, then you forget about the thing for a while, but it turns out to be important down the road. Like some heroes will be fighting a bad guy, and things will look bleak for them. But then out of nowhere this skeleton army will arrive as reinforcements or something, thus turning the tide of battle. Then you go, ah-ha. So that's why that little salamander summoned those skeletons. Everything makes sense now, and in retrospect is elegant in its simplicity.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Please, don't interrupt. We are trying to enjoy an important subplot.
<br />

<br />
Now where were we. Oh, look! One of the skeletons has stepped forward to introduce himself. But the skeleton doesn't have a name. You should give him one! What will you name the skeleton?
<br />

<br />
&gt; Clattersworth
<br />
&gt; Bonebone
<br />
&gt; Captain Nibbles
<br />
&gt; Fossilbee Oldington the Third
<br />
&gt; Mr. Ribs
<br />
&gt; Skulligan Malone<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/04/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=007981">"[A6I5] VBVS: Bonebone! Bonebone!!!"</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You declare this loyal follower to be: Bonebone! Bonebone is most pleased with his gentlemanly appellation. 
<br />

<br />
Hang on. Another skeleton approaches to receive a title. In fact, it looks like they all want names! You decide to name them all, one by one.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Just ignore her. She had her chance to be important, but turned the offer down. The rest of us are just trying to get on with our lives.
<br />

<br />
Now, what will you name the next skeleton?

<br />
You are now Spades Slick.
<br />

<br />
It appears that you will be the focus of an exciting new sub plot. That is, if everyone's ok with that. You're not sure. Is that allowed, you wonder? Is anyone going to throw a tantrum and make us look at something else?
<br />

<br />
Good news, Spades. It looks like your sub plot checks out. You have the green light, whenever you're ready.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/07/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=008013">"[A6I5] SS: Gaze over balcony at horizon."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
There was some commotion up here earlier. That guy flipped your bed over this balcony and you fell in the water like a thousand feet below. You had to climb all the way back up, sopping wet. You think he said something about English? You don't see any sign of the rival mob boss though. You'll have to investigate.
<br />

<br />
You might not have much time to find him though. The sun is setting on the horizon. What are all those things floating over the water? You can't quite make them out, even with your awesome cyborg eye, which can probably make you see better. Maybe. I'm not sure. I don't actually know anything about cybernetics to tell you the truth. I just gave you a red eye because I thought it looked cool.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/07/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=008014">"[A6I5] SS: Inspect green torso."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Looks like this asshole in the white wig is dead. Yes, the same asshole who nursed you back to health even though he didn't have to, and even though he kind of promised he wouldn't do stuff like that by way of some vague pledge involving a yellow ruler. But he saved your life anyway because his heart was just that big. You're welcome.
<br />

<br />
You weren't listening to any of that because you don't care.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/07/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=008015">"[A6I5] SS: Take wand."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You're not gonna take the wand because obviously magic is fake. Come on. What sort of buffoon would try to wield that thing under any circumstance?
<br />

<br />
You will however take the horns. They'll make a nice trophy. You always thought taking trophies from guys you killed was a cool idea. Or at least from guys you wish you killed, who you happen to find dead.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/07/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=008016">"[A6I5] SS: Investigate."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
This appears to be the murder weapon. Looks like English was the trigger man, then ditched the weapon by the body for some reason. You've never seen the guy, but you heard he carries a big overpowered gold machine gun. 
<br />

<br />
Pretty garish in your view. The man has no subtlety whatsoever. You and he sure have different styles when it comes to running an organized crime outfit. You honestly think he might be some sort of huge manchild.
<br />

<br />
And I honestly think you might be right.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/07/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=008017">"[A6I5] SS: Equip."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
You take the GOLDEN CUESTAFF. Holy crap this thing is huge. Good thing you have robot arms now. The weapon weighs several hundred pounds, but to a hulk like him it's light as a feather. And to a cyborg like you, it's light as a slightly heavier feather.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/07/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=008018">"[A6I5] SS: Search for English."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Man, how sweet would it be if you could use his own weapon against him when you get your reven... HEY! WHO GOES THERE!
<br />

<br />
Ah. Of course. It's the cute little dame who tended to you while you were bedridden. Her soup was so delicious. Whoa, what are these dumb horns doing on your head? Those don't belong there. You toss them on the ground and stomp on them nonchalantly.
<br />

<br />
She's shaking like a leaf! She must be terrified. You assure her there's nothing to be afraid of anymore. Everything's gonna be ok. The asshole in the white wig is dead.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/07/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=008019">"[A6I5] SS: Interrogate Ms. Paint."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Now that you've settled her nerves down, which you haven't actually, you ask her where the guy who did this went. She says she doesn't know. She's been hiding since he smacked her across the face with his cane. You say he did WHAT, why I oughta! She says she thinks he's probably gone now. You say oh. Any idea which way he went? She says no. You say hmm. Any idea what she might be doing later? She asks what do you mean? You say any dinner plans or...
<br />

<br />
Hey! Slick! What exactly are your intentions toward Ms. Paint??? You could at least wait until the blood is dry before making your move. I know you've always had your shitty cybernetic eye on her. Yes, the same eye that's probably just a useless piece of red glass overlapping an otherwise perfectly healthy eye. Yeah, that one.
<br />

<br />
Oh fuck it. Who am I to stand between you two? You obviously make an adorable couple. Why should I let my rotten luck with the ladies rain on your parade. That's it, I'm calling it. I'm declaring your ship to be officially canon.
<br />

<br />
Now don't fuck this up, Slick.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/07/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=008020">"[A6I5] SS: Inquire about personals."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
Personals she says? Yeah you say. Your personal items. What items she wonders? You know, all the shit you had on you before that guy turned you into a damn robot. Like your hat and stuff. Oh! Yes, she knows exactly where all that is.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/07/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=008021">"[A6I5] SS: Follow."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
She says this way. But please try to be quiet in case the green beast is still nearby!<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/07/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=008022">"[A6I5] Ms. Paint: Retrieve personals."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
She leads you to one of the mansion's several dozen pantries and retrieves your box of stuff.
<br />

<br />
Here you go she says.<br><br><br>
 <b> 04/07/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=008023">"[A6I5] SS: Inspect personals."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
The hat was a little worse for the wear, but she took it to the tailor to have it repaired. Tailor, what tailor you say. The one that appears when you pull his pin from the little doll. She said she put the pin back though because the man was rather grouchy and unpleasant. 
<br />

<br />
Wait a minute...
<br />

<br />
The surly mob of puppet people look you up and down, glance at your CUESTAFF, and shrug. Yep, you're the new boss, they appear to tacitly confirm.
<br />

<br />
Ms. Paint, you say. There's a vacancy in the gang's eight-spot. You got anything more suitable to wear?

Might of taken one blow to the head too many when that universe exploded. Hey, why did that universe explode again? Can't recall for the life of you. <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar</span>. What? <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar</span>'s his name, the guy says. Oh yeah, that's right. Now you remember, you used his crowbar a while ago to smash a priceless clock to pieces. You have his crowbar he asks?? No, you lost track of it. Any idea where it is? No clue you say. Damn he says.
<br />

<br />
You ask him how they can get out of here. Go somewhere to regroup and make some plans. Hatch some schemes. Maybe draw a map or two. Preferably in a hideout. He says he can lead you back to one of the gang's old haunts. You say after you then. He says hey. Yeah? What happened to the old boss he wonders. Is he dead or something? You say none of your damn business. Now get moving.<br><br><br>

You leave Damara's room and great Caesar's stab wound what is even going on here. <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar</span> where the hell are you leading us you ask. He says it's the Doc's old apartment. Really posh digs. Primo location too, at least it was before the universe exploded. Why are there giant holes in the walls through which can be seen an abundance of blinding green plasma, you inquire. He says because the apartment is now floating somewhere inside a huge sun. A sun you say. Well shit. No wonder it's so hot you could cook breakfast on your cranial plates. Hiding out in the middle of a big sun doesn't sound like a real tenable predicament, does it <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar</span>. No boss, he supposes it does not. Sounds like it's actually kind of a shitty predicament, doesn't it <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar</span>. Yes boss, he supposes it does. A predicament defying any sense of reason, safety, physical comfort, and most laws of science probably. He wouldn't know about that boss. You'll have to ask a scientist. You got a sassy mouth on you <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar</span>, you say to <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar</span>. A real sassy mouth.
<br />

<br />
He says if you don't want to stay, that's fine. There are contingencies in place. Contingencies you say? He says Doc's suite had an emergency exit which the gang could flee through whenever things got too hot to handle. Circumstances, he says, which never once presented themselves, until now, in the most literal way possible. Yeah. Yeah you say. Because of the sun. Yes he says. Because of the sun.

You show him your hand, which is now mostly unfamiliar to you, because it's made of metal. You put your hand down quickly because that didn't serve your rhetorical purpose at all. He says if you insist. The exit is in the room with the clock in it. Do you remember where that is? You say what do you look like, a moron? Of course you remember. Then after you he says.<br><br><br>

Some of the guys get distracted over there in the lounge. Just a quick match of TABLE STICKBALL, a fun game they made up which is based on their hats.

So this is it huh you say. Why's he keep the exit in the room with the clock anyway? <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar</span> says the exit's in the room with the clock because the exit IS the clock. You say you see. You look the clock up and down. Doesn't look the same as you remember. It was a lot fancier when you smashed it with the <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar</span>. You mean the crowbar. All purple and gold and... ticking. As if deciding the fate of someone you don't know or care about. Someone who doesn't understand a golden opportunity when she sees it. <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/scorpio.gif" border="0" /><span style="color: #005682">sdkljfhkldhfsdkhfk</span><.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/scorpio.gif" border="0" /> Someone whose behavior may have been controversial, and whose sentence apparently had to be arbitrated by a magic timepiece. Just as well you smashed it. That way nobody could outsource their judgment to the verdict of a stupid clock. Yes you definitely thought all that now. Wait. What happened to the pendulum? The ball thingy you mean. <span style="color: #2ed73a">Crowbar</span> says it broke. You see. Alright.
<br />

<br />
Anyway none of that matters now. How are you supposed to exit through this thing? Guess you have to open it? Yes he says. How you say. He says oh you know. Gotta pry it open. If only they had a tool with which to pry. Perhaps a tool which is notorious for its prying ability, which also happens to be its sole purpose. You wouldn't happen to know where such a tool might be, would you, he asks? No, he supposes not. There he goes again with that smart mouth. Nothing but sass from this guy. You're starting to miss your old right hand man. At least when he got sick of your shit, he would just turn around and light a cigarette.<br><br><br>

<br />

<br />
THE MALE IS NOT VERY SMART. THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT A HUMAN BIRTHDAY. AND HE DOESN'T HAVE A NAME YET? AND MORE STUPID THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES.

A YOUNG MALE CHERUB HAS ACHIEVED TOTAL DOMINATION OVER HIS QUEST. THUS UNLOCKING HIS MAGIC MYSTERY PLANET. AND THEREFORE. GAINING SUPREME MASTERY OVER ALL EVENTS IN REALITY. CANONICAL OR OTHERWISE.
<br />

<br />
HE BECAME A GOD TIER OBVIOUSLY. IT WAS EASY, INVOLVING A TRIVIAL ACT OF SELF SUICIDE. IT WAS NOT A VERY BIG DEAL AT ALL. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE THE BEST. YOU BECOME THE BEST THING QUITE CASUALLY. AND OFF SCREEN. LIKE IT'S NOT EVEN THAT IMPORTANT.<br><br><br>

 <b> 06/12/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=008147">"WITH EACH GOD TIER HE CLIMBED."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
HE GOT A NEW ACHIEVEMENT BADGE SEWN ON TO HIS KIDDIE CAMPER HANDYSASH. WHICH ALSO MAY BE A THING THAT'S NOT LITERALLY REAL. LIKE MANY OTHER THINGS. WHICH DON'T SEEM TO HAVE LITERAL REALITY, BUT EXIST ANYWAY. GETTING NEW BADGES HELPS YOU UNDERSTAND STUPID THINGS LIKE THAT BETTER. IN OTHER WORDS. THEY ARE MOSTLY POINTLESS.
<br />

<br />
LIKE GIFT OF GAB. WHICH IS ESPECIALLY USELESS TO OUR HERO. SINCE THERE IS NOBODY FOR HIM TO &quot;TALK&quot; TO EXCEPT FOR A RUDE CLOWN. AND ALL HIS DUMB GREEN FRIENDS, I GUESS. AND HE COULD ALREADY TALK TO THEM REGARDLESS? SO. WHAT THE FUCK.
<br />

<br />
THE BADGES ARE ALL SO SHITTY. I BARELY EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY. ONE OF THEM LETS YOU ACQUIRE OBJECTS WITH YOUR BARE HANDS. NO CAPTCHALOGUES REQUIRED. WOW, IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE! THERE IS ANOTHER ONE. AND I'M NOT JOKING HERE. THAT GRANTS YOU THE ABILITY TO HAVE NON AWKWARD PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS.
<br />

<br />
I WISH I WAS MAKING THIS UP. I REALLY DO.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/12/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=008148">"BUT THERE WAS ONE BADGE HE GOT."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
THAT WAS NOT A PITIFUL WASTE OF HIS TIME. A SKELETON KEY BADGE. 
<br />

<br />
HAVING THIS BADGE MEANT THAT HE COULD AUTOMATICALLY UNLOCK. ANY LOCK HE WANTED TO! 
<br />

<br />
INCLUDING ALL THE CONTRAPTIONS ON THIS PLANET. ALLOWING HIM TO OFFICIALLY AND PERMANENTLY ASSUME CONTROL OF. A PROPERTY OF HIS EXPERIENTIAL CONTINUUM WHICH I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE IS CALLED. &quot;THE NARRATIVE&quot;.
<br />

<br />
AND DUE TO HIS UNQUESTIONED SUPREMACY OVER A LOT OF THINGS. HE IS NOW ABLE TO COMMANDEER THIS ENIGMATIC MEDIUM. WHILE TOTALLY UNIMPEDED BY THE GHOSTLY VOICE OF A SARCASTIC DOUCHE.<br><br><br>

IT'S ME.

<br />
AND AS IT HAPPENS. MY DREAM IS A *FACT*.
<br />

<br />
I HAVE TAKEN OVER THIS &quot;STORY&quot;. AND I WILL NOW RETELL IT ACCORDING TO MY UNDERSTANDING AND LEVEL OF INTEREST. I WILL ADDITIONALLY PROVIDE AN HONEST AND BRUTAL CRITIQUE OF THE EVENTS AND THE WAY THEY HAVE BEEN SHOWN. BY UTILIZING THE MOST POTENT WEAPON ANYONE COULD EVER HOPE TO ALLOCATE TO HIS SPECIBUS. IT IS THE WEAPON. OF &quot;SATIRE&quot;.
<br />

<br />
OH MY GOD. THIS IS GOING TO BE SO GREAT. HAS ANYONE EVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE??<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/12/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=008150">"I DOUBT IT."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
ALL I HAVE TO DO. IS KEEP WORKING THE MAGIC. WITH MY FUCKING COMPUTER PENCIL. YES!!!
<br />

<br />
DRAWING IS EASY. DON'T LET ANYONE EVER TELL YOU IT ISN'T. YOU WORK HARD. AND HONE YOUR CRAFT. AND IGNORE THE HATERS. UNTIL YOU ARE IN. &quot;THE ZONE&quot;.
<br />

<br />
NOW EXCUSE ME WHILE I DRAW A SHITTY ROOM.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/12/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=008151">"MALE: EXAMINE ROOM."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
YOU EXAMINE YOUR SHITTY ROOM.
<br />

<br />
YOU ARE THE MALE. I'M CALLING HIM YOU FOR SOME REASON. THAT IS HOW THIS IDIOTIC ADVENTURE GOES USUALLY. THE GUY ON THE SCREEN. THAT'S YOU. 
<br />

<br />
CONFUSED YET?? HA HA. IT ONLY GOES DOWN HILL FROM HERE. PREPARE TO BE FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY. AS MORE THINGS HAPPEN.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/12/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=008152">"MALE: DO SOME STUFF."</a></b><br><br>

<br />

<br />

<br />
THE YOU MALE FUCKS AROUND A LOT LIKE THIS. BOUNCING AROUND AND JITTERING, WASTING TIME. BUT THE SECRET IS THAT IT'S ACTUALLY ME FUCKING AROUND. I MOVE THIS GUY AROUND LIKE A PUPPET. WITH MY IMAGINARY HAND. SEE?<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/12/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=008153">"MALE: GO OPEN THAT CHEST."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
AND I TELL MY PUPPET WHAT TO DO. BY TYPING ORDERS IN THE THING. WHILE PRETENDING THAT *YOU* ARE TYPING THEM. IT IS A DISINGENUOUS RUSE AT BEST. TO MAKE YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE GUIDING MY PUPPET. WHILE ALSO BIZARRELY INSISTING THAT YOU *ARE* THE PUPPET, BY CALLING HIM YOU. I UNSUCCESSFULLY STRIVE TO IMMERSE YOU IN AN EXPERIENCE. THAT NO ONE WITH A BRAIN. COULD EVER CONCEIVABLY WISH TO PARTICIPATE IN REGARDLESS.
<br />

<br />
BUT IN THE END. THE JOKE OF IT ALL IS. IT'S JUST ME TELLING MYSELF WHAT TO DO WITH MY PUPPET. AND THEN DOING IT. YOU WILL AGREE THIS IS THE HEIGHT OF CREATIVE SELF INDULGENCE. 
<br />

<br />
IN FACT, FOR ME TO EVEN BE MOCKING THE PRACTICE. ALMOST FEELS. INCESTUOUSLY MASTURBATORY. 
<br />

<br />
(EVEN THOUGH THAT IS A REDUNDANT PHRASE FOR CHERUBS...)<br><br><br>

<br />
ALL ABOARD THE IDIOT WAGON!
<br />

<br />
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT HAPPENS ALMOST EVERY SCREEN. AS OPPOSED TO ACCOMPLISHING THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT, OR MAKE SENSE. LET'S TAKE NOTE OF THE FACT THAT I AM SLAMMING THIS TENDENCY. AND MOVE ON.<br><br><br>

<br />

<br />
YOU NOTICE BY NOW MY STORY TELLING GENIUS. I DREW MY PUPPET. AND I DREW HIS ROOM. AND THAT'S IT. NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO IS MOVE HIM AROUND THE ROOM AND MAKE HIM DO MEANINGLESS THINGS FOR &quot;LAUGHS&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
THIS WAY. I CAN MAKE SO MANY OF THESE STORY RECTANGLES SO FAST.
<br />

<br />
SO IT SEEMS TO EVERYONE WHO IS STUPID ENOUGH. TO LOOK AT MY RECTANGLES IN THE FIRST PLACE. THAT SO MUCH IS HAPPENING. AND THE &quot;PLOT&quot; IS ADVANCING AT BREAK NECK SPEED!<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/12/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=008158">"THIS IS JUST A CLEVER TRICK THOUGH."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS. THERE IS NO PLOT.
<br />

<br />
NOTHING IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING EVER. JUST A LOT OF BULLSHIT LIKE THIS. WITH CAKES AND CARDS FLYING EVERY WHICH WAY. AND YOU ARE JUST SITTING THERE.

FROWNING AT IT.<br><br><br>
 <b> 06/12/13  <br> <a href="?s=6&p=008159">"MALE: EXERCISE FREEDOM TO LEAVE ROOM."</a></b><br><br>

<br />
THE LUCKY MALE IS OBLIVIOUS TO HIS PRIVILEGE. OF NOT BEING CHAINED TO HIS ROOM, WITH THE HORRIBLE SISTER HE DOESN'T HAVE. THE ADVANTAGE MAKES HIM WAY TOO OVERPOWERED, AND THEREFORE HE IS WHAT SOME REFER TO AS A &quot;HUMAN MARY SUE&quot;. THIS MAKES HIM LESS SYMPATHETIC, AND GIVES YOU ANOTHER REASON. TO ACTIVELY ROUTE FOR HIS DEATH.
<br />

<br />
HE GOES DOWNSTAIRS. AND YOU THINK, AH HA. THIS IS IT. SOMETHING IMPORTANT IS HAPPENING. BUT YOUR OBSERVATION IS ANOTHER BRAINLESS FALLACY. THE THING HAPPENING HERE IS JUST AS POINTLESS AS EVERYTHING ELSE.
<br />

<br />
THE LARGER HOMO SAPIEN IS OBVIOUSLY ATTEMPTING TO HELP THE MALE GROW UP AND BECOME *STRONG*. THROUGH A RITE OF PASSAGE INVOLVING SWEETS. POSSIBLY TO HELP THE MALE BECOME A TRICKSTER?
<br />

BUT THE MALE IS STUBBORN AND REFUSES. LIKE AN IDIOT.<br><br><br>

<br />

<br />
IT ALSO BEGINS TO DAWN ON YOU. THAT I WAS THE ONE ALL ALONG. WHO ILLUSTRATED THIS FANTASTIC CARTOON RECTANGLE. WHICH YOU REMEMBER THAT YOU SAW BEFORE SOMEWHERE. AND YOU NOW FIND THIS REVELATION TO BE. ALMOST AS RETROACTIVELY PLAUSIBLE. AS IT IS MIND BLOWING.
<br />

<br />
IT BRINGS TO MIND A FAMOUS QUOTE. FROM A CELEBRATED POET OF YORE. THAT I THINK GOES LIKE THIS.
<br />

<br />
&quot;WELL SHIT. THAT'S A HELL OF A MYSTERY. NO ONE THOUGHT WAS A MYSTERY. AND DIDN'T EVEN REALLY NEED SOLVING. BUT DAMN IF IT DIDN'T JUST GET SOLVED. SO NICE WORK.&quot;

THIS IS WHAT MASTER STORY TELLERS REFER TO AS A &quot;VISUAL CALLBACK&quot;. TRULY EXCEPTIONAL PROFESSIONALS OFTEN WILL TAKE AN OLD DRAWING THEY DID. THAT SHOWS A SIMILAR SITUATION. AND DO A COUPLE OF HALF ASSED THINGS. LIKE CHANGE THE COLORS. TO MAKE IT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT.

The thing zooms into the circle representing Derse and suddenly a character select screen explodes into action. Yet again, you find yourself overwhelmed by feelings of narrative empowerment as you agonize over which of these two lawless ladies you will hitch your wagon to as you blaze a new trail through the treacherous frontiers of interactive fiction...

It appears the current path is too corrupted to continue. You can't even open the dialoglog. It is simply too shitty.

Perhaps this part of the story will clear up a little later, and you will be able to resume this arc. Until then, no dice.<br><br><br>

You return to the character select screen upon having completed one of the above arcs. Oh yeah, that's right. You forgot you even came from this select screen. Some of these choosable paths start getting a little long, you think. Per the drill, you double check to make sure you've clicked on them all before proceeding.

On the other hand, if this is your first time seeing this page, then welcome to the p=008199 character select screen. It's like a triple scoop of ice cream piled generously atop your waffle cone of free will, making you a truly happy camper. You begin to wonder why this paragraph didn't come first. &quot;Kind of burying the lede there,&quot; to quote your private observation verbatim.<br><br><br>

<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: we just cycled right back to caledfwelsh like a bunch of tools</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: that is the most stupid convoluted ass backward way to get a sword out of a stone i can even imagine</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">what you will need to do is ready the young frog for its journey to skaia</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">i will prepare skaia to receive it by deploying the battlefield from our old session</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">this will bring fertility to the void session and allow the frog to mature when he completes his journey</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: SO YOU WANT US TO MAKE ANOTHER FROG?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">no!</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">when the time is right, you just have to release the one thats already there</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: WHERE IS IT?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">it fell into the forge</span>

<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">in the years since it has sunk all the way down to the planets core</span>

<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: WHY NOT?</span>

<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: COULD IT BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE A CRAPPY EVIL VERSION OF YOURSELF, AND THE MIGHTY ECHIDNA JUST POSSIBLY HAS TOO MUCH SELF RESPECT TO BOTHER DIGNIFYING THE FARCE YOU'VE BECOME?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">it is not important why, and it changes nothing</span>

<span style="color: #626262">KARKAT: GRATEFUL?!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">youre getting the chance to set right what went so horribly wrong</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: that crap is all over this session.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i'm trying to blow it away wherever i see it, but there's just so much.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: I couldn't even begin to speculate as to the nature of the disturbing phenomena.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Could you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: nah.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i just know it's super gross!</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yes!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i learned how to turn into wind and swoosh around about a year ago.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i was fighting jack and found myself in a tight spot. it was just me and him, facing each other man to man.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but he got the drop on me, and put me in one of his most dastardly choke holds! his deadly blade was poised for a lethal stab through my heart.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i thought for sure i was a goner, when suddenly i poofed away from his tentacly grasp like houdini's slippery ghost. later i rematerialized to seize the tactical advantage!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: oh yeah... then i saw you. heh.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you threatened to cut my throat for some reason, and then laughed, which was weird.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i dunno.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but i think it might have to do with this new power i have.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: What power?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it's not a god tier power.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it's something else. something i got when i stuck my hand in a magic thing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: A magic thing?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: um, that's a long story.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: one involving pirates.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Pirates??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i said it's a long story!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: anyway, when i put my hand in the thing...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i became all... blurry.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Blurry.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: and i kept randomly getting blurry and disappearing.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: and now i think i'm sort of unstuck in existence.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: like i'm not fully a part of reality anymore, or bound by the rules governing it.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: ...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: man, i'm doing a terrible job explaining this.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ok, the bottom line is, now i just randomly disappear sometimes!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: and i reappear somewhere else in time and space.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but it's not really like normal time travel.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: at least, i don't think so.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: with regular time travel, the rules are pretty strict.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: either paradox space already accounted for your time traveling, and you were always supposed to do it all along...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: or you messed up, and changed something you weren't supposed to. in which case you just made a bad timeline, and everyone dies or something. right?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Sure.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but this isn't like that.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i'm not sure how i know, but it feels like these jumps are totally outside all those rules.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: when i jump somewhere, like in the past...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i think i can actually change stuff that isn't supposed to be changed.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: which makes me kinda nervous!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Hmm.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Can you demonstrate this ability?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: not really.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i mean, not intentionally.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i can't seem to control the jumps.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: maybe that's for the best though.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: if i could control it, and tried to use it to my advantage, i would probably just make a huge mess of things.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #008282">TEREZI: Y3S, YOU WOULD</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Even so, it will be worth noting if you're able to refine the ability.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Could you please keep me informed of any developments?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yeah!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: And while you're at it, maybe you could tell us exactly what happened just after we arrived.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ummmm...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: well, we were all pretty confused at first.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you all just appeared out of nowhere, and started babbling about evil jade.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you asked me what happened, but i didn't know anything because i just got there myself, and was all alone.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but then it was cool, we all just walked around the land of hills and stone henges, or whatever it's called, and caught up a bit on the last three years.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: we were trying to figure out what to do, and decided it would be a good idea to try and meet up with all the new kids.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but we had no idea where they were.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: and i still don't, except i have since determined that my teen nanna is evil too.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but she is more like an evil robot than a scary wolf girl. um, but i digress.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: so we were planning to make some scouting expeditions to the new planets to look for them, and everything was fine.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: that is, until evil jade showed up.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: she made you all disappear again, and then came after me, but i used my windy powers to evade her, which really pissed her off!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: so she beat the crap out of me. :(</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but then i randomly zapped away, and have been running from her ever since.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i am swishing the breeze around like crazy to throw her off my trail, but she keeps finding me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: she's so crafty!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: That's good.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: We need you out there if we're going to stand a chance of accomplishing anything.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: I agree with our prior conclusions. Finding the other players is imperative.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Given the current state of the session, I would not be surprised if they are all prisoners as well.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: Do you think you can find them?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yes, i can try.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: what should i do when i find them?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: ...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: That's a good question.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: heheh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: First, I guess just tell them,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: We're here.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: alright.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: I don't know. We'll figure something out.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: if i see your mom, is there anything you want me to tell her?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: My mom?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yes. i mean, your kid mom, obviously.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #b536da">ROSE: I know.</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> I mean, aside from the fact that she is insane and evil</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> She is one of the few organic beings who will ever realize perfe%ion</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Miss Crocker is now a vessel for a cunning, malicious artificial intelligence whose neural netroni% and ontology buffers and stuff like that have somehow managed to far surpass even my own</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Clearly she has procured ma%imum advantage from her apprenticeship under me, although I must admit not even I in all my hypercognitive percipience was quite aware that said tutelage was even taking place</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> One must inviolably deduce via tons of math that this is because I am just that clopdarned STRONG at mentoring, even on an involuntary basis</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> I am so proud of her</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Ok, all that bullshit aside,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: What's this about her becoming evil?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> The thing about Jane becoming evil is</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> In the process of achieving perfe%ion...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> It seems there is a ludi%ly high probability that she has become evil</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Does that answer your question?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Admittedly it is a blemish</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Her imperfect meatmind has been fully fiddling hijacked by a supercomputer and that is the operative transmutation here</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> To such e%ceptional beings of class and breeding as she and I, considerations of morality and alignment are trifling details</span>

<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Why.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Why what</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> To have such convenient access to fresh milk</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> The mare thought of it, I must say puts a little giddyup in my phantom legs</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> I must admit the notion of lactic discharge jetting from one's swollen pectoral masses...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> It strikes me as positively indecorous</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Yet fascinatingly, this ability only manifests itself in human females</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> As opposed to how one would reasonably e%pect dairy to originate, which is from the corpulent udder of a sublimely chiseled male musclebeast</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Or failing that, certain species found within the butler genus</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Let's not talk about the pantaloons anymore.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Roxy and I became god tiers, but I don't remember exactly how.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Then I saw the Batterwitch.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: So I charged her with my sword, so as to ruin her shit.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Yes</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: That would have been a pretty fucking important thing to mention up front, don't you think?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: As opposed to stringing me along with all that atrocious lactation bullshit.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Yes</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> We never talk, Dirk</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: You are without a doubt the shittiest mystical guide anyone has ever had.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> I am not sure about that</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Dave says he had a similarly <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arspritetxt_shit.gif" border="0" />ty guide once</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Do you remember our puppet, Dirk?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Yes</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: What kind of stupid question is that. How could I forget the C man?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: He was a true friend. Which is more than I can say for some people.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> A good friend in the plush, yes, but as a sprite he was apparently insufferable</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> See, you don't realize how lucky you are to have a guide like me</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Cal was his sprite??</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Yes, for a while</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Then Dave went back in time and became one himself</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Now he is part bird</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Did I mention he's part bird?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Uh, no?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #f2a400">DIRK: Again, that's the exact kind of information that should be appearing higher up in our conversations.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Of course, this means he is not the Real Dave</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Davesprite served as Real Dave's sprite</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> But he is only the unreal version of Dave insofar as I am the unreal version of you</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> By which I mean, a much improved version</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> I must say, while the troll part of me doesn't give a silly figging shoot about any of this, the part of me that splintered from you has found the brotherly reunion to be everything which you and I dared not imagine, and more</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> Bird Dave and I are getting along famously and STRENGTHENING our familial bonds like a sweet pair of mother<.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arspritetxt_fuckers.gif" border="0" /></span>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> A two man menagerie of sideshow frickups, together at last</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> I didn't mean Bird Dave</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">ARQUIUSPRITE: <.img src="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/storyfiles/hs2/scraps/arquius_shades.png" border="0" /> You should message him</span>

<br />
Wow!!!!! Those cool new cartridge features have exploded on to your desktop computer once again! Now we're talking. This is some serious Web 2.0 shit, right here. Maybe even... Web 3.0, dare you say? No, let's not get carried away. It isn't THAT cool. But wait, look! Another three options to pick from. The carousel of choice spins round and round, while the dervish of free will starts whirling his ass off. It's making you dizzy with empowerment, and nausea.
<br />

<br />
Wait a minute.
<br />

<br />
Phooey, you scream at the top of your lungs. More of this annoying stardust is clogging up the UI, rendering all choices useless except for one. So much for Web 2.0, you gripe like a douche. Might as well be reading interactive media in the STONE AGE, you add, making sure everyone nearby can hear you. 
<br />

<br />
Maybe later it'll clear up. Until then, you click the only working option, and trudge listlessly through the one dimensional narrative. Just like the early settlers used to, before they had toilets, or cures for stuff.<br><br><br>

<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: the thing is</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: being a time guy</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: like actually MASTERING time travel</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: im pretty sure what that involves is</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: learning to never use it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: see its like karate</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: well</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: its more like what they SAY about karate</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: that you learn it so you dont use it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: but i mean we all know the truth about karate is if you know karate then obviously in reality you use it all the time</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: like doing lethal fuckin crane kicks and sweet karate chops while walking down the street just cause you can</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: its a god damn no brainer thats what you do with karate</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: but see with time travel</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: all the stuff about learning it so you dont have to use it is true</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: theres no good that can come of it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: you can crunch the logic on the loops all you want</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: but all youre doing is painting yourself into a corner</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: creating inevitabilities you have to rehearse and enact or face death for yourself or everyone you know</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: and sometimes facing death is the very inevitability you have to rehearse</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: and then you wait and wait knowing its coming and knowing it has to happen</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: how do you think it made me feel when we were gathering up all those frogs</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: and i knew the whole time in a little while you would have to watch me get shot</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: but i couldnt say anything or it would mess it all up</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: all cause i thought it would be cool to be marty mcfuckin fly</span>

<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: but instead of shredding johnny b goode on guitar to get my parents to bang</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: but the delorean was actually a big purple moon</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: and the 1980s was me accidentally reaching god tier and living on a shitty meteor for a while</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: and i guess rose was doc brown</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: doc brown accidentally reached god tier too</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">the fact is youre going to have to rely on those powers if you want to stand any chance against a lord of time</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">it is safe to expect he can only be challenged by someone with a similar command over the aspect</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: where are all these presumptions coming from</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: if you can use swords why dont you take the welsh cueball sword and fight him yourself</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: i bet you could fuck him up</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: youre probably even more extra strong now that youve succumbed to the bark side</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #4ac925">JADE:</span> <span style="color: #000000">dave i am perfectly aware of the awesome powers granted to me by the bark side</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #e00707">DAVE: i have no intention of fighting him</span>

Wow!!!!! Those cool new cartridge features have exploded on to your desktop computer once again! Now we're talking. This is some serious Web 2.0 shit, right here. Maybe even... Web 3.0, dare you say? No, let's not get carried away. It isn't THAT cool. But wait, look! Another three options too pick from. The carousel of choice spins round and round, while the dervish of free will...
<br />

<br />
The dervish of free will can kiss your ass, you grumble through a double facepalm. The UI is still seized up with ugly jittering artifacts. At least this time a different path is available, it would seem. You guess you'll click the only working option, and resign yourself to a straightforward, choiceless procession through the story, as usual. Linear as she goes, you grouse as you click the Kanaya button. 
<br />

<br />
Web 2.0? More like Web two point NO. You're starting to wish the internet was never invented.<br><br><br>

No, let's not get carried away. Hold the phone. Looks like this piece of shit is still broken. Who is surprised by this? The answer is nobody.
<br />

<br />
At least the third and final option is probably available now. Let's see what Rose and Terezi are up to.
<br />

<br />
What? What do you you mean it doesn't work. Are you sure? Try it again.
<br />

<br />
You're kidding. No, that can't be right.
<br />

<br />
Only the first option is working? So we have to go through the Dave arc AGAIN?
<br />

<br />
Sure, what the hell. Looks like we're reading the Dave arc again. Thanks for nothing, &quot;The Information Age&quot;.

Wow!!!!! Those cool new cartridge features have exploded on to your desktop computer once again! Now we're talking. This is some serious Web 2.0 shit, right here. Maybe even... Web 3.0, dare you say? Yes, you do dare say, just so you don't have to read this whole stupid paragraph yet again. WEB 3.0 IT IS!

The important thing is it appears the Rose and Terezi arc is available now. So you click on that and read it.

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: ive been tryin to concentrate on something</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: so i built this sick pyramid deal to help focus my brain chi and spiritual majyyks and if at all possible to blitz my chakras out the yin yang</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: no</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: what are you trying to do exactly?</span>

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: i have to make a spikeball appear out of thin air</span>

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: theyre basically freebies for void players i think</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i remember making some of those cubes with my alchemiter.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i think that's what a blank card makes? so yeah, they're super primitive.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but making pumpkins is pretty impressive. they're like... these big ol' vegetables.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: no dude</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: pumpkins are helllls o primitive</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: voidwise theyre like the middle square on a bingo card</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: tricks...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i guess i don't know any actual TRICKS per se, aside from how to use some of my powers.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but i don't know if the same tricks apply to using your powers...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: u said u could help tho</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i said MAYBE i could!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i dunno, i was just throwing it out there.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: like, maybe if i told you about some of the experiences i had when i was learning to do my windy stuff, you might have some kind of... voidey epiphany?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: a voidey epiphany</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: k then</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: im all ears johnny windsock</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: let loose ur wisdom whilst i rake in the epiphanies</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ok, um,</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i've noticed whenever i learn to do new things with my powers, it's usually in response to something. like something important that has to be done.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: so why are you trying to make this spike ball?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: and how important does it feel to you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: well at first i was mainly tryin to make it because dog girl was forcing me to</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: but now i think i keep trying because im gettin obsessed with making this dumb spikeball and PO'd that i cant do it</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i see.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: what actually IS this spike ball, if you don't mind my asking?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: its an alien egg</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: 4 tha trolls</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: to hatch em all back to life</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: but only to be ruled by an evil witch so its gonna be shitty for them</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: so yeah its kind of an important thing</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: but at the same time it would probably be terrible if i actually made it so...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: then maybe the fact that you're conflicted about it is why you're having trouble?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: yeh maybe</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: if you think it's important to make, but don't want to give it to the bad guys, why don't you just...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: break out of jail?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: then you could try to make the egg at your own discretion, and use it however you think is best.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: idk</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: i broke outta here once already and the fuckin witch just nabbed me again</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: and that was BEFORE she recruited jakes omnipotent goofball grandma to zap me back here the moment i step outside</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yeah. it is a tricky situation with grimbark jade on the loose, that's for sure.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: but i've been managing to evade her.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i just swoosh the breeze around to hide my scent, and dissolve into wind and fly away if she finds me.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: maybe you could do something like that too?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it seems to me if anyone should be able to avoid detection using their powers, it would be a void player.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: get it? a void... as in, avoid?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: heh.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: that is legit sound reasoning yo</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: + a way lame pun 2 boot</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: but remember how we were just talkin about the fact that when it comes to god tier shit i dont know what the eff im doin??</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you really look a lot like rose.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: she is looking for you, by the way.</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: she said...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: she's looking forward to meeting you?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: awwwwww</span>

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: well if u see her again before i do tell her i cant wait to meet her too</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: sure!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: there's nothing to be nervous about though.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: she's just a nice nerd who likes to read and knit.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: i shouldnt be surprised to hear that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: me and all my friends are a bunch of silly nerds too</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: even dirk who thinks hes 2 cool 4 school</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: when in reality he is nowhere close to clearing the coolness threshold which exempts one from attending an educational institution :p</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: speaking of which...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i've been wondering where he is?</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: i figured he got thrown in jail too</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: although come to think of it i probly would have heard a bloody ruckus by now resulting from his inevitable escape attempt</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: hmm.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: im not that worried about him though hes good at takin care of himself</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: but</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: there is still one of my friends im worried about the most</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: who?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: shes my best friend</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yes.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: but she was always kind of a special best friend</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: and last time i saw her she was in big trouble</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: oh no.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: where is she?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: in the afterlife</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: being dead</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: ...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: her bro killed her</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: which is bad enough</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: but now hes out there</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: hunting for her ghost</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: shes doing her best to hide</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: but her bro is an awful and relentless piece of shit and im afraid</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: im afraid she might be already gone :(</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you're right, that is very concerning.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: who is she? would i know of her?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: dunno</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: how in the loop are you on cherubs?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: oh!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: surprisingly, i know a LOT about that subject.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: for instance, did you know they turn into gigantic snakes when they have sex?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: :O</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: :O</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: :O</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i know. weird, right?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: that's probably not very relevant to the topic at hand, though.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: yeah prob not</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: anyway u know about lord english right</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: yep</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: shes supposed to be critical to defeatin him somehow</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: shes going on some quest out there to find a deadlier version of herself or whatever</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: i dunno that could be all be true...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: and maybe its selfish of me but all i rly care about now is if shes ok??</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it should be a piece of cake.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you just wear it when you go to sleep, and it comes with you in your dreams.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: then you find your cherub friend, put it on her finger, and bring her back!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i think you can only use it once though. so once she's wearing it, it would be hers forever, or at least as long as she wants it.</span>

<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it's no big deal, really.</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: aw man, this is going to sound dumb.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: hm?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: there was a girl who i was considering giving it to, for some reason.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: remember? she was the diabolical one who figured prominently in my long story.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: um</span>

<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: and she found out i had it, and...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: honestly, i'm not sure why it even crossed my mind to give it to her?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i guess i was just used to the idea that i liked her for some reason.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: at least i thought i did.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it was a stupid idea based on hardly anything. like one day of conversations.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: i don't know.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: but u dont mind trustin me w it?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: no!</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: it's funny, after spending some time with a person who is legitimately crazy, it becomes easy to tell right away when someone...</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: isn't?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: lol</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: u sure about that</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: well, yeah, everyone is a little crazy. i just mean not BAD crazy.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: besides, you don't even want the ring for yourself.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: you want to give it to someone you care about.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: that is what makes you one of the good guys.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: what a nice thing to say</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: i bet sayin stuff like that is why ur their leader</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: ill wait here</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: no need to set off the alarms with a daring escape just yet</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: lets keep em lulled into a false sense of control over the sitch</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: we can start scheming under their nose while u keep sneakin around undetected</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: the last thing we want is for all hell to break loose before we know what were doin</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: yeah, that's a good plan.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #0715cd">JOHN: if i had to guess, i'd say you must be the leader of your team squad too, right?</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: naaaw</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: that's jane</span>

<span style="color: #ff6ff2">ROXY: as you can see shes the one with a knack for ruthless executive authority</span>

<br />
HERE TO ONWARD. I WILL REFER TO THIS MALE AS. THE ALPHA MALE.

<br />
THE ALPHA MALE IS LESS BAD THAN THE ORIGINAL MALE. HE IS NOT AS ANNOYING. AND HAS NO TENDENCY TO RANDOMLY APPEAR AND BOTHER PEOPLE. HE ALSO LIKES COOL SWORDS. AND &quot;IRONY&quot; I GUESS.

<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: If I can stop this universe from 8eing cre8ted, then the young Lord of Time will never have hatched in the first place.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #77003c">MEENAH: serk have you lost it</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Please, Meenah. Don't insult me. I've given this a lot of thought.</span>

<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: And as an ancient, highly experienced sylph, I wield an unprecedented a8ility to heal.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: A doomed timeline is really just an anatomical feature of a much larger organism. Like a capillary which comes to an end, 8ecause it has withered and died.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I 8elieve I will 8e a8le to heal this offshoot.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: And with enough time and patience, I am confident I can restore its vitality to such a gr8 extent, it will effectively take over as the alpha timeline, thus reducing English to a lost footnote of paradox space.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: Then the new alpha timeline will flourish under my immortal care. I will watch over it for eternity, assuring peace and harmony everywhere. There will 8e a new progeny of universes, and those universes will 8eget more universes, and each will 8enefit from my good grace. I will personally make sure nothing like the English mishap ever occurs again.</span>
<br />
<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: I mean, this is mostly theoretical, of course.</span>

<span style="color: #005682">ARANEA: 8ut the most important thing here is that I am involved now.</span>

We upgraded the whole <a href="http://www.whatpumpkin.com/home.php" target="_blank">What Pumpkin store</a>. There's a bunch of new stuff to buy as well! Including these lovely shirts:

<br><br>

All these great designs were by <a href="http://rendigo.tumblr.com/post/60450019230/my-beta-kids-shirts-are-officially-up-for-sale-in" target="_blank">Rennie Kingsley</a>. Alpha kid designs by the same artist will be coming soon too.

<br><br>

There will be so many other cool things hitting WP this fall, I honestly couldn't list them all off the top of my head. Just keep refreshing the site constantly. Even in your sleep. Then you will be ok.
